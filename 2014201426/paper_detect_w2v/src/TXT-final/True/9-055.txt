known to be true at the entrances and exits of the loop  top-down approach   and another in which we generate the inductive assertion directly from the statements of the loop  bottom-up approach . 
	i. 	introduction 
     the desirability of proving that a given program is correct has been noted repeatedly in the computer literature  floyd  has provided a proof method for showing partial correctness of iterative  flowchart  programs  that is  it shows that if the program terminates  a given input-output relation is satisfied. the method involves cutting each loop of the program  attaching to each cutpoint an  inductive assertion   which is a predicate in first-order predicate calculus   and constructing verification conditions for each path from one assertion to another  or back to i t s e l f   . the program is partially correct if a l l the verification conditions are valid. elements of these tech-
niques have been shown amenable to mechanization. king   for example  has actually written a 'verifier' program which  given the proper inductive assertions for programs written in a simplified algol-like language  can prove partial correctness. thus  it is f a i r l y clear that the parts of this method which in-
volve generating verification conditions from inductive assertions and then proving or disproving their v a l i dity is a d i f f i c u l t but programmable problem. however  as king puts i t   finding a set of assertions to 'cut' each loop of the program  depends on our deep understanding of the program's performance and requires some sophisticated intellectual endeavor . 
     in this paper we show some general heuristic techniques for automatically finding a set of inductive assertions which w i l l allow proving partial correct-
ness of a given program. more precisely  we are given a flowchart program with input variables x  which are not changed during execution   program variables y 
 used as temporary storage during the execution of the program   and output variables z  which are assigned values only at the end of the execution . in addition  we are given  input predicate  $ x   which puts restrictions on the input variables  and  output predicate   kx z   which indicates the desired relation between the input and output variables. given a set of cutpoints which cut a l l the loops  our task is to attach an appropriate inductive assertion qi to each cutpoint i. 
　　we distinguish between two general approaches:  a  top-down approach in which we obtain the inductive assertion inside a loop by analyzing the predicates 
which are known to be true at the entrances and exits of the loop  and 
 b  bottom-up approach in which we generate the i n ductive assertion of a loop directly from the statements of the loop. 
     for  toy  examples  having only a single loop  it is generally clear that the top-down approach is the natural method to use. however  this is definitely not the case for real  non-trivial  programs with more complex loop structure. in this case some bottom-up techniques were found indispensible. most commonly we have found it necessary to combine the two techniques  with the bottom-up methods dominant. 
     preliminary attempts to attack the problem of finding assertions have been made by floyd  private communication   and cooper . heuristic rules basically similar to some of our top-down rules have been discovered independently by wegbreit . elspas  et a l .   used  difference equations  derived from the program's statements which i s   in essence  a bottom-up approach. 
     we handle programs with arrays separately  since generating assertions involving quantification over the indices of arrays requires special treatment. thus in section ii we discuss heuristic techniques for flowchart programs without arrays  while in section i i i we extend the treatment to programs with arrays. in section iv  conclusion  we discuss open problems and possible implications of our techniques. related problems 
where these approaches seem applicable include proving termination of programs  and discovering the input and 
1 
output assertions of a program. 
     our emphasis in this paper is on the exposition of the rules themselves and we are purposely somewhat vague on other problems  such as correctly locating the cutpoints or ordering the application of the rules. 	though we do not enter into details  we assume that whenever possible we conduct immediate tests on the consistency  with known information  of a 
new component for an assertion as soon as it is generated  and that algebraic simplifications and manipulations are done whenever necessary. 
　　　ii heuristics for programs without arrays a. top-down approach. 
     we begin by listing the top-down rules  which may be divided into two classes: entry rules and exit rules. 
     1. entry rules. these rules are intuitively obvious  but provide valuable information in a surprising number of cases. 
rule en`1. any conjunct* in the input predicate $ x  
may be added to any q  it need not be proven since the input variables are not changed inside the program  rule en1. any predicate known to be true upon first 
reaching a cutpoint i should be tried in qi. 
     1. exit rules. for simplicity in the statement of these rules  we assume that a cutpoint is attached to the arc immediately before an exit test of the loop. thus we may consider an exit from a loop to be of the form 
where t. is the exit test  p  is some conjunct of a predicate known to be true when the exit test f i r s t holds  1 is the cutpoint on the arc leading into the exit test  and q1 is the assertion which we wish to discover. we attempt to extract information from p. 
if a predicate is expressed as a conjunction a1aa1 ........an   then each a is a conjunct  of the predicate. 

       it is possible to continue to design rules for obtaining r for specific forms of p.   but since our aim is to explain the general tone of these techniques  we w i l l not go into further details in this direction. b. bottom-up approach. 
       all of the rules given above have in common that they expect to be provided with some information on 
either what conditions were true upon entering the loop or what conditions were expected to hold upon completing the loop  or both . however.  it is possible to produce conjuncts of the assertion q without considering predicates already established elsewhere in the program. in order to accomplish this goal we shall look for a predicate which is an invariant of the loop l   i.e.  it remains true upon repeated executions of the loop. 
       clearly  any conjunct in the inductive assertion of a loop must be an invariant of the loop. however  in the top-down rules this is usually the last fact which is established about a prospective assertion. 
in the pure bottom-up approach  assertions which arise  naturally  from the computations in the loop are d i rectly generated - and only afterward checked for relevance to the overall proof. 
     most invariants may be traced back to the fact that at any stage of the computation  those assignment statements which are on the same paths through the loop have been executed an identical number of times  and this is a 'constant' which may be used to relate the variables iterated. 
       for an assignment statement y. ＊*＊ f x y  we let y1 denote the value of y. after n executions of the 
 1 
statement  while y; ' indicates the   i n i t i a l   value of y1 upon f i r s t reaching a given cutpolnt of the loop. 
       our technique for finding invariants involves constructing an  operator table  in which we record useful information for each operator. among the eitries for an operator are its definition  using  weaker  ope-
rators    a description of a general computation after n iterations  and other common identities which facil i t a t e simplifications. for example  for + our table 
w i l l include the fact that for an assignment statement of the form y1 + y1+k  in general y1 n =y 1 + t k   1 where kvj is the value of k before the j - t h iteration of the assignment statement. important identities are also noted including that for a constant c   n 	n   .. 
i c cn  and that 	♀ i  	' -i-*- . rules for producing 
i-1 	i-1 	1 
invariants linking variables which receive assignments on different paths through the loop are presently being developed. here we present rules only for the

assertions w i l l show the program partially correct. we clearly could have used the transitivity rule here  but for this example  the amount of work required is about the same. 
	iv. 	conclusion 
   clearly  the rules and examples given in this paper are far from being a general system for finding inductive assertions. 	more and better rules are needed  particularly for array assertions  which tend to be complex and unwieldy. 
　　in addition  before the rules can be incorporated into a practical framework  we must order their application. that i s   at each step we must provide more exact criteria for deciding which rule to apply and on which cutpoint of the program. the order in which the rules are presented in each subclass does implicitly provide a partial specification. thus we presently 
would try to apply ex1  and only if it failed try ex1  etc. moreover  we generally would try to gather information on simple variables using the rules of section ii before attempting to treat array assertions. 
   the more basic  and open  questions are  a  whether to attempt top-down or bottom-up techniques f i r s t for a given loop  and  b  which loop of a program should be treated f i r s t . although we experimented with various orderings in the examples in this paper  we have tentatively formulated a more fixed approach. our present inclination is to f i r s t use top-down rules from the  physical  beginning of the program.  since in general there is more than one outer loop  usually only entrance rules are applicable.  then we use bottom-up rules for the same loop  to create a p true after exit from the f i r s t loop containing as much information as possible. we continue with the next outer loop in a similar manner. if  however  we are stymied and unable to find a loop assertion  we start with top-down rules from the end of the program  and try to work backwards towards the beginning. 
   a more sophisticated approach would require a weighted evaluation function capable of making a very cursory scan of the program. this function would identify loops which seemed 'promising1  i.e. likely to yield valuable information rapidly  and apply selected rules f i r s t to these loops. 
　　since some of the rules could continue searching for a possibly non-existent form of assertion almost indefinitely  the transitivity rule  for example   such rules would have a  weak  version and a  strong  version. the  weak  version would be used in the 
i n i t i a l attempt to find an assertion  and would  give-
up  rapidly if it did not provide an almost immediate solution. 	then other  possibly more appropriate  rules may be tried on the cutpoint. 	only if a l l rules failed to add relevant information  would the  strong  version be applied. 	this division is parallel to the human attempt to f i r s t find what is  obviously  true in the loop  and only afterwards bring out the fine points. 
   the overall strategy we have adopted in this paper has been to find assertions strong enough to prove the partial correctness in as few steps as possible. thus  in general  we attempt to directly produce a near-exact description of the operation of a loop  without going through numerous intermediate stages where we are unable to shorn either validity or unsatlsfiability. if our heuristic is wrong  this fact w i l l be revealed relatively rapidly by generating an unsatisfiable verification condition. we then may try a weaker alter-
native claim. we feel that this is the approach which should be taken in order to construct a practical system which could be added to a program verifier. 
   we believe that the bottom-up approach may also be used to solve other problems. for example  in the partition program  example 1   the inductive assertion was actually found without using the w given by the 
programmer. in one single step 1 may be generated from q   and thus we have 'discovered' what the program 
does without the use of additional information. 	this feature of the bottom-up approach can probably be most 
useful for strengthening a too-weak assertion  i.e.  revealing that the program does more than is claimed in w . 
   another apparent application is for proving termination using well-founded sets. for termination  predicates qi and functions ui are required  where ui  a mapping to the well-founded set  has its domain bounded by qi and descends each time the loop is executed. here again the bottom-up approach is useful since no w is provided. we have already begun investigating bottom-up methods for generating both the qi 's and the ui 's which w i l l ensure termination. 
   the ultimate goal of automatic assertion generation is almost certainly unattainable; thus the optimal system would involve man-machine interaction. whenever it was unable to generate the proper assertion  the 
machine would supply detailed questions on problematic relations among variables and possible failure points  incorrect loops  of the program. clearly  a partial specification of the assertions  provided by the programmer  could shorten this entire process.

be proved from the s-m-n theorem and the recursion theorem. 
     to demonstrate the unsolvability of a program minimization problem  for a universal machine   it is therefore sufficient to show that the descriptions concerned include an effectively enumerable  i n f i n i t e l y diverse set of i/o descriptions. this implies  for example  that the program minimization problem for the singleton functions  for the f i n i t e decision functions  and even for the decision functions of cardinality 1 is 
1 
unsolvable   whenever the length measure is recursive. 
for example  suppose the minimal programs are required to operate within a certain bound on the computational complexity  apart from an arbitrary additive constant. then it is clear that the proof of theorem 1 is applicable without change. 
     these unsolvability results do not mean that a l l interesting program minimization problems are entirely beyond the reach of mechanical procedures  as theorem 1 w i l l show. 
     the following definitions generalize the concept of limiting recursion introduced bv 
     pager  has shown that the last-mentioned problem is unsolvable even when the length measure is not recursive. further  he established the surprising fact that the minimization problem is unsolvable for a certain f i n i t e l y diverse set of decision functions  regardless of the length measure employed . 
     in view of pager's results it may be asked whether the requirement that the length measure be recursive is superfluous in 
theorem 1. the answer is no  although the requirement can be weakened somewhat . to prove t h i s   it is only necessary to specify some sequence of f i n i t e decision functions gold   1   . 


such that any program is a program for at most one of these functions  plus an arbitrary procedure for obtaining a particular program for each function in the sequence; then the length measure can readily be defined to guarantee the minimality of these particular programs. 
　　it is interesting to note that theorem 1 s t i l l holds for certain non-1 descriptions. understood  if there is a predicate p k-limitinq decidable on axn such that for sea  p 1 x  holds i f f a set of integers is k-limiting 
r.e. if it is empty or the range of a function

k-limiting recursive on n. o-limiting recursive is the same as recursive  and 1limiting recursive is abbreviated as limiting recursive. 
gold  also putnam  1 j  has shown that

so that g is  k+1 -limiting recursive. 
     roughly speaking  theorem 1 states that finding minimal programs is no more d i f f i c u l t than enumerating programs in order of nondecreasing length or deciding whether a given program realizes a given description 
 whichever is harder   where the   d i f f i c u l t y   of a k-limiting recursive functional is k. 
     theorem 1. given: a programmable machine m  a length measure such that programs are klimiting r.e. in order of nondecreasing length  and a set a of realizable  uniformly k-limiting decidable program descriptions. 
     then the program minimization problem for a is k-limiting recursively solvable. 
     proof: since programs are k-limiting r.e. in order of nondecreasing length  there is a k-limiting recursive function f which maps n 

     theorem 1. given: a k-limiting recursive length measure such that programs are kl i m i t i n g r.e. in order of non-decreasing length and a set a of realizable  uniformly k-limiting decidable program descriptions. 
     then the problem of finding a l l minimal programs realizing any 1ea is k-limiting recursively solvable. 


     now if the set of indices of the minimal programs realizing 1 is expressed by i t s canonical index 

where cp is the characteristic function of p  with p defined as in theorem 1  then application of lemma 1 shows i . to be kl i m i t i n g recursive on 
     note that because of the assumption in theorem 1 that the length measure is kl i m i t i n g recursive. theorem 1 cannot be regarded as a consequence of theorem 1. note also that any  k-1 -limiting recursive length measure satisfies the conditions of theorem 1  by theorem 1 . 
     theorems 1 and 1 are the main results of this paper. the remaining theorems i l l u s t r a t e their application. 
     theorem 1. for any recursive length measure  the problem of finding a l l minimal programs for f i n i t e programmable functions is l i m i t i n g recursive  each f i n i t e function is assumed to be specified by a program description which l i s t s the argument-value pairs of the function in any order . 


finding a l l minimal programs for any f i n i t e function is l i m i t i n g recursive. 
     theorem 1. given a recursive length measure and a machine m which computes total functions only  the problem of finding minimal programs for functions programmable on m is l i m i t i n g recursive  each programmable function is assumed to be specified by a program description which l i s t s the argumentvalue pairs of the function in any order . 

     gold had already shown that the problem of finding any programs {not necessarily minimal  for members of a r.e  class of total functions is l i m i t i n g recursive  and feldman 
 	remarked that this can be extended in an 
e 
obvious way to finding minimal programs when programs are r.e. in order of nondecreasing length. theorem 1 strengthens this result s l i g h t l y   as there are recursive length measures for which programs are not 
r.e. in order of nondecreasing length  e.g.  define  so that the sequence enumerates a r . e .   nonrecursive set without repetition . 
     theorem 1. for any m and any limiting recursive length measure  the problem of finding minimal programs for functions programmable on m is 1-limiting recursive  as in theorem 1  the problem is interpreted in terms of program descriptions  where any description l i s t s the argument-value pairs of a programmable function in any order . 

     note that it is known from the work of gold that the problem is not in general limiting recursive. 
     the theorem is readily generalized to descriptions which prescribe divergent computations for some inputs. the minimization problem remains 1-limiting recursive. 
1. 	remarks on induction and iterated limiting recursion 
     deduction is concerned with the derivation of particular conseauences from oeneral 
1 
premises  while induction proceeds in the opposite direction. the problem of finding an algorithm {minimal or otherwise  for a function  after inspection of some but not a l l values of the function  is clearly of the inductive type: the complete algorithm proposed on the basis of incomplete information expresses a generalization about the function sampled. non-trivial inductive problems are inherently  unsolvable  in the sense that no terminating procedure exists for generating  correct  generalizations; any unverified consequence of a proposed generalization may turn out to be in error. this motivated gold's d e f i n i t i o n of l i m i t i n g recursive predicates and functionals  which are more powerful than their non-limiting counterparts. he noted that a  thinker  employing a procedure for function  or  blackbox   i d e n t i f i c a t i o n in the l i m i t and using the current guess of a function's identity as a basis for goal-directed a c t i v i t y would be acting on correct information eventually. in this sense  therefore  some unsolvable problems are within the reach of mechanical procedures  the most general function i d e n t i f i c a t i o n problem  however  is 1-limiting recursive. can any mechanical system be conceived which in some sense  solves  a 1limiting recursive problem  not if attention is restricted to a single  thinker  generating a single sequence of guesses; however  suppose that instead of a single thinker  each of an ever growing number of such thinkers t d   t .   . . . with universal computational power observes the non-terminating sequence 
 y1'z1   y1  ......which enumerates some p a r t i a l recursive function o. at any time the i ' t h thinker t. regards as his best guess the shortest program   i f any  he has been able to find which  in the time available  has given correct outputs for inputs yo y1 an * either no output or a correct output for any other argument tested. it is clear that each thinker w i l l eventually be guessing a program for a subset of $; furthermore  a l l but a f i n i t e number of the thinkers w i l l be guessing programs for  j  eventually. in this iterated l i m i t i n g sense the expanding community successfully identifies *. of course there is no strategy effective in the l i m i t for deciding in general which thinkers are guessing programs for $ at any time. to interpret third-order l i m i t processes  one might envisage a growing number of expanding communities of the above type  each committed to a d i s t i n c t value of a certain parameter. at most f i n i t e l y many of the unbounded communities would in   general be  unsuccessful . similarly s t i l l higherorder processes could be interpreted.

 a code into t o t a l functions would also be used for a mixture of f i n i t e and i n f i n i t e descriptions; one d i g i t   say 1  would be reserved as terminator and a l l function values corresponding tp points beyond the end of a f i n i t e description would be set to 1.

 for the f i n i t e decision functions  note that the functions computed with any f i n i t e set of programs can be diagonalized to yield a f i n i t e decision function which requires a program not in the given set. to prove i n f i n i t e diversity for the 1-element decision functions  it is s u f f i c i e n t to show that no set of n programs can include a program for each 1element decision function whose arguments are in a fixed set of 1 integers; but for this many arguments at least 1 of the programs must give identical results { i f any   so that two unsymmetric decision functions are missed.

 functions are regarded as a special case of functionals. 
 the equivalence follows from the fact that f 1  is independent of n .   . . .   n     so that the iterated l i m i t of g must exist.

 this d i f f e r s from gold's d e f i n i t i o n   which expresses l i m i t i n g recursive enumerability in terms of l i m i t i n g semi-decidability. however  the definitions can be shown to be equivalent  for k = l   . 
 actually  feldman was concerned with  occams enumerations  of formal grammars  but the problem of finding minimal grammars for languages is essentially the same as that of finding minimal programs for decision functions.
