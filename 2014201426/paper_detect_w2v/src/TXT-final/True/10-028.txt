	1 	introduction 
       this pape r depcribes aspect r of a n a p p l i e a t i o n s - o r i e n t e d system for c r e a t i n g n a t u r a l langruage i n t e r f a c e s between computer software and casual users. like the u n d e r l y i n g researen i t s e l f   the paper is focused on the human engineering involved in designing p r a c t i c a l rnd comfortable i n t e r f a c e s . this focus has lead to the i n v e s t i g a t i o n of some g e n e r a l l y neglected facets of language processing  i n c l u d i n g the processing of ireomplfte i n p u t s   the a b i l i t y to resume parsing a f t e r r e c o v e r i n g from s p e l l i n g errors and the a b i l i t y f o r naive users to input english stat.emert s at run time that  extend and p e r s o n - l i z e the language accepted by the system. the implementation of these f e a t u r e s in a convenient 
package and t h e i r i n t e g r a t i o n w i t h o t h e r human engineering features are d i s c u s s e d . 
a. historical perspective 
       there has been mounting evidence that the c u r r e n t state of the a r t in n a t u r a l language p r o c e s s i n g   although s t i l l r e l a t i v e l y p r i m i t i v e   i s s u f f i c i e n t f o r d e a l i n g w i t h some very real problems. for example  brown and burton  1  have developed a usable system for computer a s s i s t e d i n s t r u c t i o n   and a number of language systems have been developed for i n t e r f a c i n g to data bases  i n c l u d i n g the rel system developed by thompson and thompson  1   the lunar system of woods et a l .  1   and the planes system ol 
walt1  1 . the sigart n e w s l e t t e r f o r february  1  contains a c o l l e c t i o n cf 1  short overviews of research e f f o r t s in the general area of n a t u r a l language i n t e r f a c e s . 
       tnere has r i s e been a growing demand for a p p l i c a t i o n systems. at sri's a r t i f i c i a l i r t e l l u g e n e center alone  many programs are r i p e for the a d d i t i o n of language c a p a b i l i t i e s   including systems f o r data base accessing  i n d u s t r i a l automation  automatic programming  deduct i o r   and judgmental reasoning. the appeal cf these systems to b u i l d e r s ana users .-'like is g r e a t l y enhanced when they are able to accept natural language i n p u t s . 
b. the 	lifer system 
       to add n a t u r a l language c a p a b i l i t i e s to a v a r i e t y of e x i s t i n g r e f t w a r e systems  sri has c'velopcd a package of convenient t o o l s   co.llectively called lifer  which f a c i l i t a t e the rapid c o n s t r u c t i o n of natural language i n t e r f a c e s   
the idea behind the lifer system  hendrix 1  1  	is to adapt e x i s t i n g computational 	l i n g u i s t i e technology tc 	p r a c t i c a l 	a p p l i c a t i o n s while extend ing the 	technology to rreet human needs. these 	human needs are perhaps not 	c e n t r a l to the science of 	language but 	they are. c e r t a i n l y c e n t r a l f a c t o r s 	i n i t s a p p l i c a t i o n . 	subsequent sections o f 
t h i s paper present some- of the human engineering features for i n t e r f a c e users included in lifer.* several of the n o n l i n g u i s t i c f e a t u r e s were i n s p i r e d by cr taken d i r e c t l y * * from interlisp  teitelmen 1   an i n t e r a c t i v e lisp programming system which is i t s e l f an excellent example of t h o u g h t f u l human engineering in computer software. 
	1 	human engineering for interface users 
       some of lifer's human engineering features ere e x e m p l i f i e d in the i n t e r a c t i o n s shown in figure 1. these p a r t i c u l a r i n t e r a c t i o n s involve a lifer i n t e r f a c e to a data base of i n f o r m a t i o n about employees of a u n i v e r s i t y . analogous lifer i n t e r f a c e s to other types cf software may also be const rue t e d . 
       from s language processing view  lifer's most i n t e r e s t i n g f e a t u r e s are the e l l i p t i c a l processor  the s p e l l i n g c o r r e c t o r   and the paraphraser. 
* the lifer manual  hendrix 1  describes how to define special-purpose languages for p a r t i c u l a r a p p l i c a t i o n s . it also includes i n f o r m a t i o n about lifer's human engineering features f o r i n t e r f a c e b u i l d e r s and about issues concerning applied computational l i n g u i s t i c s . 
*  lifer makes d i r e c t use of the interlisp s p e l l i n g 
c o r r e c t o r end the use and redo f e a t u r e s .

however  the u s a b i l i t y of lifer is i n f l u f n c e d net so much by the poner of i n d i v i d u a l features -s by the aggregate e f f e c t of having a number of festunes 
working together to support the user  it if the mix of f e a t u r e s at various l e v e l s of complexity t h a t should be looked for in studying the i n t e r a c t i o n s of the example. 
a. entering an input 
       a f t e r 1nterlisp  the language in which lifer is c u r r e n t l y implemented  outputs its. prompt c h a r a c t e r s   the user may type in q u e r i e s   commands  or a s s e r t i o n s to the system ir o r d i n a r y e n g l i s h . * there is no needd to call the parser e x p l i c i t l y . both upper and lower ease are a l l o w e d   and punctuation is o p t i o n a l . for example  in the f i r s t l i n e of figure 1  the user asks the question  what is the s a l a r y of eric johnson   a . f t e r interlisp types the prompt   i -   . 
h. 	feedback 
       lifer pnrses t y p i c a l 	i n p u t s   	such  s i n t e r a c t i o n 	1  	in w e l l under a second of cpu time 
on the dec pdp k l - 1 . * * however  when the cpu is h e a v i l y loaded  users may become concerned about t h e i r inputs a f t e r even a b r i e f d   i r y . lifer seeks to r e l i e v e t h i s a n x i e t y by p r o v i d i n g a constant stream of feedback. for example  the crt cursor cr t e l e t y p e p r i n t head f o l l o w s the parsing o p e r a t i o n as it works through an input from l e f t to r i g h t . this feedback is rn important humanizing f e a t u r e   analogous to eye c o n t a c t   he jd nodding  and beard s t r o k i n g . another feedback is that the system types the message 
parsed! 
when lifer has f i n i s h e d analyzing an input and is ready t o c a l l a p p l i c a t i o n 	software 	  i . e .   	the system to which lifer is p r o v i d i n g an i n t e r f a c e   	to answer the q u e s t i o n   c a r r y out 	the 	command  or a s s i m i l a t e the a s s e r t i o n communicated 	by the i n p u t . 
c. 	incomplete inputs 
	if the 	user has j u s t 	asked 
           what is the salary of eric johnson and now wishes to know johnson's p o s i t i o n and date h i r e d   it is f a r more convenient and n a t u r a l to simply ask 
                   position and date hired than to l a b o r i o u s l y type out 
what is the position and date hired of eric johnson accommodating 	the human tendency to abbreviate i n p u t s 	is an 	important c o n s i d e r a t i o n for a p p l i c a t i o n s systems. 	although some other systems make 	it possible 	to d e f i n e grammars that 	accept incomplete sentences as  complete  	i n p u t s   * * * lifer 
* of course  o n l y   subset of english is a c t u a l l y accepted by any p a r t i c u l a r i n t e r f a c e   but experience has shown that t h i s subset can be designed to have wide coverage in v p a r t i c u l a r a p p l i c a t i o n area. 
*  timings arc based on a vocabulary of 1 words and a grammar c o n t a i n i n g over 1 production r u l e s . makes t h i s unnecessary by a u t c m n t i c a i i y deducing possible e l l i p t i c a l   i . e .   incomplete  s t r u c t u r e s from the grammars s u p p l i e d f e r complete c o n s t r u c t i o n s .  see i n t e r a c t i o n   of figure 1.

       a s i g n i f i c a n t c o n s i d e r a t i o n when dealing with humen-gencrated 	inputs is 	that 	they o f t e n contain s p e l l i n g 	e r r o r s . 	whether 	the 	user a c t u a l l y 
m i s s p e l l s h word or1 simply mistypes i t   the e f f e c t is the same: garbled i n p u t . in c o n s t r u c t i n g a. language system f o r the sake ol studying language understanding  t h e r e is no r e a l need for a s p e l l i n g c o r r e c t i o n c a p a b i l i t y   but users of a p p l i c a t i o n systems are j u s t l y i r r i t a t e d when s p e l l i n g e r r o r s cause a b o r t i o n of processing ard r e s u l t in delays and tedious r e t y p i n g .

l. 	provjding 	comfortable 	lingustic 	coverage 
　　　in the fin   ana-lysis  the most important piece of human engineering for users is that of supplying an interface language covering the range of linguistic structures nceded to communicate comfortably vith the application software  such features as spelling correction and e l l i p t i c a l 
procrssinc  although important  can never make up 
for deficiencies in basic linguistic capabilities. 
　　　given the current state of the art in language processing  it would br futile to attempt to provide a definitive specification of english 
　　　 1   there is a reasonable manual describing how tc user the system. 
	a l l 	implementation of special 	featured 
　　　this section presents an overview of ljfer's i m p l t ion o f the spelling correction  
e l l i p t i c   	processor  and pata phraser. 
having sufficient generality t r  over ail potenttial applications. lifer's approach to adequate a. 	on 1f spelling correction' 

cover age is not to pursue  - definitive specification  but rather tc supply the framework  guidance  and mechanisms that allow an interface builder  in a reasonable amount of time  to create a solid  practicable  special purpose language d e f i n i t i o n   covering the spectrum of linguistic structures most relevant to  . particular appl ieation .* 
　　　no attempt can be made here to de-tail the particular set of interactive functions that lifer provides for specifying  n application language ** but a few key points may be me-rticned: 
　　　 1  interface builders work within the framework of interlisp  a- powerful and flexible host language vith advanced debugging f a c i l i t i e s . lower level languages may have faster execution  but. f l e x i b i l i t y and progrpmming case. are what count in building workable systems with reasonable amounts of e f f o r t . 
　　　    extensions and modificptions to the language specification may be freely mixed with cfclis to the parser. there is no grammar compiltion phase. this allows interface builders to operate in a rapid  extend-andtest mode  pnd supports features thpt modify the language at. parse time  such as the parpphrpser. 
　　　 1  the interface builder is isolated from the internal structures that lifer builds for purposes of increasing parsing efficiency. in particular  the user communicates with 
lifer in terms of simple production rules maintained internally as transition networks  woods 1 . 
　　　 1  ljfer has a powerful grammar-editing f a c i l i t y  which uses the 1nterlisp editor . 
　　　 1  lifer has a package of functions for grammar interrogation and debugging. 
　　　 1  e l l i p t i c a l constructions pre handled automatically and so need never be considered by the interface builder. 
* special purpose languages are perhaps most easily created with lifer by adopting the notion of a 
 semantic grammar   as advocated by brown and burton  1 . 
** a thorough discussion of this topic is contained in the lifer manual  hendrix  1 . 
　　　liffer uses a 1 e f t -t o- r i g ht pa r se r f o owing. i rig a simp! i f i c r t i o r of the atn system of woods 1. each time t he pa.rser discovers that it can re longer follow transitions a long the current path  
it records the failure on a fa ii point l i s t . each  entry on this l i s t indicrtes the state of the system when the failure occurre-c   i . e .   the position in the  transiticr. net and the values of various stacks and registers  and the curren.t position ir the input string. local ambiguities and false paths make- it quite norm* 1 for f a i l points tc be noted ever when a perfectly acceptable irput is processed. 
　　　if a complete parse is found for an input  thef a i l points are ignored. put if an input carrot be parsed  the list  of faiipoints is used by thf spelling corrector  which selects these faiipoir.tr. associated with the rightmost position in the input at which f a i l points were recorded. it is assumed that f a i l points occurring to the l e f t were not 
caused by spelling errors  since some transitions using tht words at those positions must have beer successful for- there to be faiipoints to theirright . 
　　　the spelling corrector further restricts the rightmost faiipoints by locking for cases in which a rightmost faiipoint g is dominated by another rightmost f a i l p o i r t f. c is dominated by f if g is a faiipoint in a subgrammar that was pushed tc in a f u t i l e attempt to follow a push bro from f. since g and f pre both rightmost faiipoints  g represents a stall pt the start node of the pushe.d-to subgrammar.  had any transition been made  g would be to the right of f.  hence  if f is restarted  g 
is reattempted as one means of transferring from f. g  therefore  does not need tc be. considered independently. all dominated rightmost faiipoints 
are dropped from consideration. 
　　　working with the rightmost  dominating faiipoints  the spelling corrector examines the associated arcs to find a l l categories of words that would allow a transition.  for push arcs  this requires an exploration of subgrammars.  using the interlisp spelling corrector  the word of the input string associated with the rightmost faiipoints is compared with the lexical items of thf categories just found. if the  misspelled  
word is sufficiently similar to any of these lexical items  the closest match is substituted. faiipoints associated with lexical categories that include the new word are then sequentially restarted until one leads to a successful parse. 
n a t u r a l language1 g e - 1 : 	h e n d r i x 
1  this may produce more spelling correction further 
to the right.  if a l l restarts f a i l   other close lexical items are substituted for the  misspelled  
word. 	if these also f a i l   lifer prints ar error 
mrssage. 
　　　lifer encourages the use of semanticaily oriented syrtactic categories  such as  emplcyee  nnd  depar ment-name   rather than such standard categories as  noun . the use of these more specialized categories greatly f a c i l i t a t e s spelling correction by severely restricting the number of possibly valid vords at any point in the parse.* 
　　　lifer's mechanism for treating e l l i p t i c a l inputs takes advantage of the assumption that specifications for application languages tend to encode a corside-rpble amount of semantic 
irformatior in the syntactic categories. 	thus  similar syntactic constructions tend to be similar semanticnlly. 	lifer's treatment of e l l i p s i s is based on this notion of s i m i l a r i t y . 	during e l l i p t i c a l processing  lifer is prepared to accept any string of vords that is syntactically analogous to any contiguous substring of words in the last input. 	  i f the last input was e l l i p t i c a l   i t s 
expansion into a complete sentence is used.  
　　　lifer's concept of analogy appeals to the syntax tree of the last input that was successfully analyzed by the system. for any contiguous substring of words in the last input  an  analogy pattern  may be defined by an abstraction process that works backwards through the old syntax tree from the words of the substring toward the root. whenever the syntax tree shows a portion of the substring to be a complete expansion of a syntactic category  the category name is substituted for that portion. the analogy pattern is the final result after a l l such substitutions. 

	figure 1: 	a syntax tree 
　　　for example  consider how an analogy pattern may be found for the substring 
of martin dev1ne  
using the syntax tree** shown in figure 1 for a

  an example lifer system  describees by sacerdoti  1  has a vocabulary of over 1 words  excluding numbers and coded symbols. this vocabulary is divided among 1 categories  1 of which contein 1 or less words. 1 categories contain 1 to 1 words  and the largest contains 
1. 
    present  is used in the sense of  to show for inspection.  
previous input  what is the salary of martin dev1ne since the martin devine portion cf the substring is a. complete expansion of  name   the substring is rewritten as of  name . similarly  since  emplcyee  expands to  name   the substring is rewritten as cf  employee . since no other portions of the substring ere complete expansions of other syntactic categories in the tree  the process stops and 1f  employee  is accepted as the most general analogy pattern. if the current input matches this analogy pattern  lifer w i l l accept it as a legitimate e l l i p t i c a l input. for example  the analogy pattern of  empl1yee   extracted from the last input  may be used to match such current e l l i p t i c a l inputs as 
of eric johnson 
     of employee 1-1 and of professors in the math department 
note that the expansion of  emplcyee  need not parallel its expansion in the old input that originated the analogy pattern. for example  of employee 1 -1 is not matched by expanding  empl1yee  to  name  but by expanding  emplcyee  to employee  id-numper . 
　　　to compute responses for e l l i p t i c a l inputs matching of  emplcy♀e   lifer wcrks i t s way back through the old syntax tree from the common parent of of  empl1yee  toward the root. first  the routine for computing the value cf an  1tem  from constituents of the production 
　　　　　　　 1tem  =  the  at'lrieu'u  is invoked  using the new value of  ekpl1ye♀   which appeared in the current e l l i p t i c a l input  and the old value of  attribute  from the last sentence. then  using the newly computed value for  1tem  and the old value for  present   a new value is similarly computed for  l1fer.t1p.grammar   the root of the syntax tree.

c. 	implementation of paraphrase 
       lifer's paraphrase mechanism also takes advrntage of semantieally o r i e n t e d s y n t a c t i c c a t e g o r i e s and makes use of syntax t r e e s . in the t y p i c a l case  the paraphraser is given a model sentence  v h i c h the system can already understand  and   paraphrase. the paraphraser's general s t r a t e g y is tc analyze the model sentence and then look f o r s i m i l a r s t r u c t u r e s in the paraphrase s t r i n g . 
	1. 	the 	basic method 
             in 	p a r t i c u l a r   	the paraphraser 	invokes the parser to produce a syntax t r e e cf the model. using 	t h i s 	t r e e   	the paraphraser determines a l l proper subphrases o f the model  	i . e .   p 1 s u b s t r i n g s t h a t are complete expansions of one of the s y n t a c t i c c a t e g o r i e s l i s t e d 	in the t r e e . 	any of these model 	subphrases t h a t also 	 ppear 	in the paraphrase s t r i n g are assumed 	to play the same r o l e in the paraphrase as in the model i t s e l f . 	thus  the 	s e m a n t i c a l l y o r i e n t e d 	s y n t a c t i c 	c a t e g o r i e s t h a t account 	for 	these 	subphrases in the model 	are reused 	to account 	f o r the corresponding subphrases of the 	paraphrase. 	moreover  	the r e l a t i o n s h i p 

between the s y n t a c t i c categories that is expressed in the syntax t r e e of the model forms a basis f o r e s t a b l i s h i n g the r e l a t i o n s h i p between the corresponding s y n t a c t i c u n i t s i n f e r r e d f o r the paraphrase. 
	a. 	defining 	a 	paraphrase 	production 
　　　　　　　　　　to f i n d correspondences between the model and the paraphrase  the subphrases of the model are f i r s t s o r t e d . longer phrases have preference over s h o r t e r phrese.s  and for two phrases of the same l e n g t h   the l e f t m o s t is taken f i r s t . for example  the sorted phrases f o r the t r e e of figure 1 ere 

since the syntax t r e e i n d i c a t e s  employee  =   name  =  martin dev1ne  both  name  and  ekployee  account f o r the same subphrast. for such cases  only the most general s y n t a c t i c category   emplgyee   is considered. 
　　　　　　　　　　beginning w i t h the 	f i r s t 	 longest  subphrase  	the subphrases are matched against sequences of words in the paraphrase s t r i n g . 	  i f a subphrase matches two sequences of words  only the l e f t m o s t match is used.  	the longer subphrases are given preference 	since matches f o r them w i l l lead to g e n e r a l i z a t i o n s 	i n c o r p o r a t i n g matches f o r the s h o r t e r phrases contained w i t h i n them. 	whenever a mptch is found  	the s y n t a c t i c category associated w i t h the subphrase 	is s u b s t i t u t e d 	f o r the matching word sequence in the paraphrase. 	this process continues u n t i l matches have been attempted 	f o r a l l subphrases. 
　　　　　　　　　　for example  suppose the paraphrase proposed f o r the question of figure 1 is 
　　　　　for martin devine give me the salary subphrases 1 and 1  l i s t e d above  do not match s u b s t r i n g s in t h i s paraphrase. subphrase 1 is not considered  since it is dominated by subphrase 1. subphrase 1 does match a sequence of words in the paraphrase s t r i n g . s u b s t i t u t i n g the associated category name for the word sequence y i e l d s a new paraphrase s t r i n g : 
　　　　　　for  employee  give me the salary subphrase 1 matche. s a sequence of words in t h i s updated paraphrase s t r i n g . the associated s u b s t i t u t i o n y i e l d s 
　　　　for  employee  give me the  attr1bute  since there are no more subphrases to t r y   the s t r u c t u r e 
	 lifer.top.grammar  	=  
　　　　　　for  employee  give me the  attr1bute  is created as a new p r o d u c t i o n to account f o r the paraphrase.

h e n d r i x 
production 	is programmed 	a u t o m a t i c a l l y from information in the syntax tree of the model. 	 n p a r t i c u l a r   	the syntax tree i n d i c a t e s which productions were used in the model to expand various s y n t a c t i c c a t e g o r i e s . 	associated with each of these productions is a 	f u n c t i o n for computing the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of associated 	subphrases from subphrase c o n s t i t u e n t s . 	the paraphraser reuses selected f u n c t i o n s of the model to create   new f u n c t i o n for the paraphrase p r o d u c t i o n . 	the manner in which t h i s is done is best i l l u s t r a t e d 	by 
example. 
　　　　　　　　　　continuing the example of figure 	1  the syntax tree 	i n d i c a t e s that 	the production 
        lifer.top.grakmar  =   present   item  was used. associated w i t h t h i s production is a f u n c t i o n f1  not shown in the f i g u r e   but referenced in the actual tree  that computes r. value for  lifer.top.grammar  from the values of  present  and  item .* using  the n o t a t i o n  # x   to i n d i c a t e  the value of  x    the r o l e of f1 may be expressed by the equation 
 # lifer.top.grammar  = f1  1 pres♀nt    kitem   another production indicated by the model syntax tree is 
        item  r  the  attribute  of  employee  this production is associated w i t h a f u n c t i o n f   where 
	# item  	= 	f  tf attribute   	/kemployee   
　　　　　　　　　　the paraphraser must define a new f u n c t i o n fn f o r the paraphrase production 
	 l1fer.t1p.grammar  	=  
　　　　　　for  empl1yee  give me the  attrjbute  moreover  the value computed by fn must be the same as the value computed as a response to the model sentence. since the categories  employe♀  and  attribute  appear on the r i g h t side of the paraphrase production  the paraphraser assumes that fn is s f u n c t i o n of * employee  and tf attr1bute . since fn must produce the same value as produced by the model c a l l to f1  the paraphraser assumes that 
	fn # employee   	 kattr1eme   	= 
	f1 # present   	*/ it♀m   
　　　　　　　　　　the syntax tree i n d i c a t e s that the expansion of  present  is independent of the expansions of  employee  and  attr1bute . hence  the paraphraser assumes // present  to be a constant in the computation of fn. that i s   the value of  present  used in the model w i l l always be used as the value of  present  in computing fn in terms of 
f1. 
in c o n t r a s t   the syntax tree shows 
 1tem  to incorporate both  employee  and  attribute . 	hence  both of these parameters to fn may influence 	# ttem . 	function 1 i n d i c a t e s the nature of t h i s i n f l u e n c e . 	therefore  	in the equation d e f i n i n g fn  	the paraphraser replaces # 1tem  by the expression t h a t computes i t : 
	fn # employee   	# attribute   	s 
f1 # present   f1 # attribute   # employee    
* since  lifer.top.grammar  is the sentence-level s y n t a c t i c category  t h i s value i s   i n f a c t   the response to the t o t a l i n p u t . 
this new equation completely s p e c i f i e s fn in terms of constants  	formal parameters of fn  	and p r e v i o u s l y defined f u n c t i o n s . 	that 	i s   fn is defined 	in terms of the constant # present  	 taken from the o r i g i n a l model i n p u t     the 	formal parameters # emplcyee  and # attkieine   and the previously defined functions f1 and f1. 
	 . 	greater generalizatiion 
             the goal of the paraphrase r o u t i n e is to account 	f o r the 	prraphrrse 	in the most general terms p o s s i b l e   	so t h r t 	new c o n s t r u c t i o n s created to account 	f o r r p a r t i c u l a r paraphrase 	w i l l cover a maximum number of new input p o s s i b i l i t i e s . 	for c e r t a i n cases  the coverage produced by the basic method presented above is extended by the psraphraser as f c l l c w r . 	suppose some mod l subphrase s that matches a substring of the paraphrase 	is associated w i t h th  	s y n t a c t i c u n i t  m  in the model syntax t r e e . 	such an  m   	in t u r n   w i l l appear in the tree a  a d i r e c t component of a more general unit  g  such that 
　　　　　　　　　　　 g  	=  	x  m  y where x and y are some   p o s s i b l y empty  sequences of l i n g u i s t i c u n i t s . 	since the subphrase 	for  g  i t s e l f was not matched 	in the paraphrase  e i t h e r the x or the y or both d i d not. appear in the peraphrase 	 at 	l e a s t not in the necessary j u x t a p o s i t i o n to  m  . 	nevertheless  	if 	the 
grammar allows 	the 	production 
	 g  	=  	 m  
and 	if the value 	assigned to  g  is the same 	for both 
      g  =   m  and  g  =  x  m  y 
then  g  is s u b s t i t u t e d for  m  in the paraphrase to produce a c o n s t r u c t i o n with broader coverage. 
for example  suppose that the model input

suppose f u r t h e r that the paraphrase is again for martin devine give me the salary unlike the e a r l i e r example in which  emplcyee  was s u b s t i t u t e d for martin devjne  the s u b s t i t u t i o n algorithm of the l a s t section now only allows  name  to be s u b s t i t u t e d . the r e s u l t a n t paraphrase is

	*. 	confinement to subgrammars 
             consider paraphrases of the form  x y z     where the model is of the form  x s y  and s is a  proper subphrase associeted with a s y n t a c t i c category  c . the paraphraser traps t h i s type of cord it ion and asks the user if y is always a paraphrase of s or is simply a paraphrase in the context of x and y. if the user i n d i c a t e s a context deperdern.cy  then processing proceeds as u s u r l . if the user i n d i c a t e s that y is a 
             paraphrase of s in every c o n t e x t   then lifer w i l l rnak* y r paraphrase of ♀ in the subgrammar accounting for  c . the influence of t h i s paraphrase w i l l then be f e l t everywhere that category  c  is used.  for example  see footnote o f section i i - l .   
	iv 	concluding remarks 
       during the l a s t year  a number of i n t e r f a c e s have been constructed using lifer  and the response from users has been e n t h u s i a s t i c . it is worth noting: that i n t e r f a c e s f o r several of the simpler a p p l i c a t i o n s took less than a week to c r e a t e . most of these simple i n t e r f a c e s were to s m a l l   r e l a t i o n a l data bases. however  i n t e r f a c e s were also constructed for a ta.sk scheduling and resource a l l o c a t i n g system  a computer-based expert system  and a program that answers questions about the r e l a t j o n s h i p s between procedures in a l a r g e body of computer code. 
       lifer has also been used in c r e a t i n g more ambitious i n t e r f a c e s . one of these  developed w i t h several man-months  but not several man-years  of e f f o r t   is the inland component of the ladder system described by sacerdoti  1 . this system  which incorporates a grammar w i t h over 1  productions  and a l e x i c o n with over 1 words  rot to mention numbers and numerous coded symbols   provides n a t u r a l language access to a r e l a t i v e l y l a r g e c o l l e c t i o n o f data that i s d i s t r i b u t e d among m u l t i p l e remote computers on the arpa n e t . 
       in summary  the experience w i t h lifer i n d i c a t e s t h a t genuinely useful n a t u r a l language i n t e r f a c e s can be created and t h a t the c r e a t i o n process takes considerably less e f f o r t than might be expected. human engineering has played a key r o l e in making t h i s p o s s i b l e . the a p p l i c a t i o n of s i m i l a r engineering to more s o p h i s t i c a t e d language processing technology  such as that developed in the sri speech understanding project  walker 1   promises to produce p r a c t i c a l systems having much greater fluency i n t h e i r u s e r ' s n a t u r a l language.

advantages of a transformational grammar for question answering

     a number of researchers in artificial intelligence  for example  woods 1  p.1 ff.    have asserted that transformational grammars are not a satisfactory basis on which to construct natural language understanding systems  primarily because of efficiency considerations. the evidence for such a claim is by no means strong  petrick 1   and it can be argued that transfer of new theoretical insights into a language understanding system based on transformational grammar is facilitated  plath  1 . this note shows that a transformational parser can also simplify problems of relating canonical representations of queries to data base representations. 
     consider a data base consisting of a set of company names each with an associated list of employees. a natural question for such a data base is m how many people does company y employ   our grammar produces an underlying tree structure whose bracketted terminal string is something like   i     from which a knuth-style semantic interpreter produces a lisp form like  1 . 
 1   employ  company y    how many  person x i     . 
 1   sizeof setx 	' x i 	' testfct 	xi 	 employ 	y 
1     
testfct would trigger extraction of names from the data base  setx would create a set of these names  and sizeof would determine the cardinality of that set. so far  this is simple enough and no difficulty arises. the first query system we constructed had a small data base of business statistics of large corporations  plath 1   petrick 1 . consider in this context a question like  what were ge's 1 earnings  . the underlying structure was something like  1   where the semantic interpreter produced a lisp form of roughly  1 . 
 1   equal  the x1  gross ge x1    some amount x i    . 
 1   setx 	' x i 	' foratleast 	1 	'x1 	 setx 	x1 
 testfct x1  gross ge 1    equal x1 x i         
foratleast 	implements 	the 	default 	quantifier  	and 
testfct finds ge's gross income. this data base also contained the total  number of employees for each company. if we were to ask 
 1  how many employees does ge have  
the system would produce an underlying structure related to  1   leading to a retrieval program like  1 . unfortunately  we need a retrieval program like  1   with   e m p l o y e e   substituted for  gross . we could of course modify the sizeof function to be sensitive to the data field it dominates and return the set rather than the cardinality of the set in appropriate cases  but this is aesthetically unattractive  although this is in fact what we did in our very first system . we could also modify our translation equations and semantic interpreter so as to be sensitive to this situation. while this might be satisfactory in one or two cases  the number of special cases can become very large. 
     in our present application  which is an english query system for the planning files of a small city near our laboratory  there are many more situations of this kind. 	one can ask 
 1  in what zone/planning area/ census tract/ etc.  is parcel 1 located  
for each of these questions  the underlying structure has a top level verb of   l o c a t e d     where the translator would prefer   z o n e   or  planning a r e a   etc. again  one could make the l o c a t e d function sensitive to its arguments  or insert the appropriate equations into the translator  but the complexity of either solution is much greater than before. 
     transformational grammars customarily have two sets of rules  cyclic rules  which apply successively to each level of embedding  and postcyclic rules  which apply globally to the entire sentence. our grammar has an additional set of rules  called string transformations  plath  1   which apply to strings of lexical trees. the transformational parsing program calls each of these sets of rules separately. since the parser is basically a tree processor  it can be applied  via an additional set of rules  to underlying structures like those for  1  and  1   and modify the structures in such a way that the semantic interpreter can produce correct code without data base specific modifications. in the case of  1   the output of the new processing phase  called the precycle  is a structure like  1  instead of a structure like  1   with a data identifica-
tion of   e m p l o y e e   rather than  gross . at the cost of an additional call to the transformational parser  we have insulated both the semantic interpreter and the data base functions from the organization of the data base  confining the necessary modifications to a single table of rules. we have not yet found a class of structural changes we wished to make because of the data base which required more than one rule. therefore  the cost of writing new rules has been much less than the cost of generating new programs for these special cases would have been. 
     while i am sure other system developers are able to solve this general problem  as they must in order to proceed in their work  we have nonetheless been pleased to note that our decision to use a transformational approach on linguistic grounds has had additional benefits on practical grounds.
