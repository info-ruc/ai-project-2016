1 	introduction 
users of natural language interfaces  should conveniently be able to express the commands and queries that the background system can deal with and the system should react quickly and accurately to all user input among other things this means that the interface must be able to cope with connected dialogue however  it does not mean that the interface must bt able to mimic human interaction on the contrary  it is erroneous to assume that humans would like to interact with cornput ers the same way as they communicate with humans  cf 
 dahlback  1b 1a  dahlback and jonsson  1 dahlback et al  1  krause  1   human computer interactions have their own sublanguages  cf g shirman and kittredge  1   whose characteristics often allow a much simpler dialogue model than models capturing human interaction 
   to illustrate some properties of such human computer interaction consider figure 1 in information retrieval systems a common user initiative is a request for domain concept information of a specified object  or set of objects utterance u1 illustrates this the requested domain concept information is the value of the property shape and the domain object is the ford fiesta costing 1 crowns unfortunately the system could not an swer the question as the propert   shapt  is not utilized in the domain  instead in utterance s1 the system provides information about its capabilities in u1 a new request for information on another property of the same domain object is presented this time the pronoun it replaces the rephrasing of the specification of the object  ic the ford fiesta costing 1 crowns in utterance u1 the user asks for the same concept information but related to another object while in u1 the object stays the same but the property is altered in u1 the property remains the same but this time the user utilizes a definite description to specify an object discussed previously  and originally specified in utterance u1 
　the dialogue model presented in this paper does not intend to mimic human conversation it is based on the observation that for information retrieval applications a common user initiative is a request for domain concept information of a specified object or set of objects  cf  ahrenberg 1   a dialogue manager utilizing this information when deciding winch action to perform for user natives concerned with accessing the application will provide efficient and robust user-friendly human computer natural language interaction 
1 	the dialogue manager 
a dialogue manager directs a natural language interface and holds information needed by the modules in the interface  including the dialogue manager itself the dialogue manager considered in this paper was designed from an analysis of a corpus of 1 dialogues using live different background systems  ahrenberg et al 1  jonsson 1   collected in wizard oz-experiments  dahlback et al 1  the dialogue manager need to be customized to account for the sublanguage carried out in a specific application customization allows us to adapt the behaviour of the interface to the requirements of the application  see jonsson  1a  1b  for details  
the results presented here are based on the customiza-

tion of the dialogue manager for three applications  other than those utilized in the design  using a set of 1 new dialogues one of the applications  cars  allows users to retrieve information from a consumers guide on properties of used cars in another application  travel the application domain was charter trips to the greek archipelago the travel application not only utilized information retrieval but also in one scenario  allowed users to order a specified charter trip 
　dialogue management information is modeled in dialogue objects these represent the constituents of the dialogue a dialogue object has two components o i k component contains static information describing the 
properties and relations of the dialogue object another is a process description of a prototypical use of the dialogue object  an action plan  jonsson  1  during the course of interaction a dialogue tree is built up from instances of dialogue objects  for more details on the 
dialogue manager see jonsson 
   two types of static parameters are distinguished situation parameters and content parameters the situation parameters specify the situation in which the dialogue object occurs  such as initiator responder and contextual information the content parameters are needed 
for focus structure and dialogue structure focus struc ture concerns the recording of entities mentioned in the discourse to allow a user to refer to them in the course of the interaction dialogue structure involves handling 
the relationships between the segments in the dialogue

1 	focus structure parameters 
as discussed above  users of information retrieval systems request database information by specifying a database object  or a set of objects  and ask for the value of a property of that object or set of objects the dialogue objects model database objects using a parameter termed objects and the domain concept information in a parameter termed properties the values  to these parameters depend on the background system and the natural language interface needs to be customized to ac count for the demands from each application  jonsson 1h  for the cars application a relational database is used and the objects are cars described bj the subparameters  manufacturer  model  year  the travel application utilizes a hierarchically structured datahase with the greek archipelago on top  then the resorts and finally the hotels at each resort however it turns out that there is no need to txphcitly represent the various levels in the hierarchy instead one single sub-parameter holding any of these object types is sufficient to illustrate this  consider figure 1 after utterance 1 the value of the objects parameter is the resort crete thi* will be changed to a set of hotels when the response from the background system is generated  s1 
　the value to the objects parameter can be explicitly provided as for instance  it is in show saab 1 of j1 modtl however  this is not often the case instead the user provides only partial information or a new set of objects by specifying properties  e g show all mtdtum size cars with a safety factor larger than 1 it is also possible to describe new objects by way of other objects as for example in u1 in figure 1 the objects parameter will achieve values from such intensionally specified object descriptions by the extensional specification provided from the database access system 

   the properties parameter models the domain concept in a sub-parameter termed aspect which can be specified  in another sub-parameter termed value for instance  utterance u1 in figure 1 bow fast is a mercedes 1  provides aspect information on the domain con cept speed which is specified by tht database manager to 1  i e the value of the aspect speed is 1 
   for some applications a third focal parameter is needed  termed secondary objects its purpose is to restrict the search in the database to allow the user to investigate objects from a subset of objects one at a time as exemplified in figure 1 the user picks out ihe set of hotels at the resort but is only interested in a subset of them if we apply the principle that holele are appended to the objects parameter if the resort remains the same  the objects parameter will hold the subset requested in u1 however  to restnet the database search in u1 to the set specified in s1 secondary objects is needed to hold the subset from which individual ob|ects art itives tigatcd 
   the focus parameters are properties of discourse segments  cf  zancanaro ct at   1    nol moves focus is maintained using a simple copving principle where each new dialogue object is instantiated with a copy of the focus parameters from the previous dialogut object  cf  seneff 1   this forms the initial context for the di alogue object and is updated with new  informition from the user initiative and the response from the background system 
   the details on how to update tht focal parameters vary and need lo hi considered when customizing tht di ilogue objects for a specific tpphcalion for instance consider tht system response s1 in hgun 1 this re sponse does not only contain the requested information on the aspect sllb-parami ter top speed it also provides information on ihi aspect sub parameter nisi specified in the previous user initiative if the valut to the objects parameter remains the same  or is a &ubset of the previous value   the value to the properties parameter will be the conjunction of tht previous valui and tht new values provided m the new move this principle is appropriate when information is presented in tables allow ing additional information to be presented conveniently  ahrenberg et at 1  
1 	dialogue structure parameters 
the dialogue is divided into three main classes on the basis of structural complexity there is one class corre sponding to the size of a dialogue  another class corresponding to the size of a discourse segment and a third class corresponding lo the size of a single speech act or dialogue move uuerancet  are not analyzed as dialogue objects  but as linguistic objects which function as vein cles of one or more moves there are various other proposals as to the number of categories needed they differ mainly on the modeling of complex units that consist of sequences of discourse segments  but do not comprise the whole dialogue for instance  loki  wachtel 1b  and s u n d i a l  bilange 1  use four in loki the levels are conversation  dialogue  exchange and move sund i a l uses the categories transaction level exchange level  intervention level and dialogue acts the feature characterizing the intermediate level  i e the dialogue and exchange levels respectivelv in wachtel's and bilange s models  is that of having a common topic  i e an object whose properties are discussed over a sequence of exchanges however  as illustrated in figure 1  a se quence of segments may hang together in a number of different ways e g by being about one object for which different properties are at issue but it ma  also be tht other way around  so that the same property is topical while difh rent objects are talked about  cf  ahreu berg et ai  1   thus only one discourse segment category is distinguished and an initiative-response  ir  structure is assumed  cf adjacency-pairs  schegloft and sacks  1   where an initiative opens a segment by introducing a new goal and the response closes the segment  dahlback 1b  
　to specify the functional role of a move we use the parameters type and topic 
　type corresponds to the llloculionarv. type of the niov  for so-called sirnplt service systems1 two subgoals can be identified  hayes and reddy 1 p 1bb  1  specifying a paramet  r to the system and 1  obtaining tht specification of a parameter initiatives an cat  gonzed atturdlliglv as being of two different types 1  update  u where users provide information to the system and 1  question q  where users obtain information from the svstem responses are categorized as answer a for database answers from ihe s stem or answers to clarification requests the dialogut manager utilizes other type ralegorif s such as greeting farewtll and discourse continuation  dc   dahlback 1b  tht latter being used for utterances from the system whose purpose i& lo keep the conversation going but thev will not b  further considered in this1 pap  r 
　topic describes winch knowledge source to contult for information retrieval applications three different knowledge sources are utilized the database for solving a task  t  acquiring information about the database 
system related  s  or  finally  the ongoing dialogue  d  if the background system allows ordering of a specified item a fourth category is needed to account for such ul terances 
　the type/topic parameters can be used to describi tin dialogue structure  n which action to be carried out b  t h j interface this in turn can be modeled in a dialogut grammar  jonsson 1a  
1 	actions for task-related initiatives 
normal!} a natural language interface to database in formation retrieval applications is user-directed i e the user initiates a request for information from the hackground svstem and the interface responds with the requested information the interface only lakes the initiative to begin a clarification request under ihree 
   'simple service sjstems  require in essence only that the customer or clienl identify certain entities to the person pruviduig the aervice these entities are parameters of the ser vice and once they are identified the service can be provided   hayes and reddy 1 p 1  
jonsson

erty copied from the initiating 1r unit the aspect slot is used to hold the parameter for which the system wants an answer and the value slot is used for the user's answer if the user answers correctly at  in u1 in figure 1  the values for properties in the initiating ir-unit are updated a qd/ad unit is identified from the type information  1 e the type of the response from the user is a otherwise the user move is regarded not to be an answer to the systems clarification request a clarification subdialogue is not initiated unless the system is able to explicitly provide alternatives to the user 
a special case of clarification request occurs when a correct specification of the parameters objects and properties is provided  but the answer is too large to print on the screen in such cases the system initiates a clarification subdialogue asking the user to restrict the number of items to be printed  for exam ple  s1 wait there are 1 car models which satisfy your requirements cars normally only shows 1 cars at a time do you want to seee them alt  the answer can be either a number a restriction such as us remove cars costing less than 1 crowns- or yes or no it is used to restrict the num-
ber of objects to output on the screen arid also in some cases affect the values of the objects parameter 
     as is used for task related user initiatives resulting in a system inswtr which provides information about the database system information can be provided on various aspects of what type of information there is in the database and what type of questions that can be used to elicit this information a i v p i o l example is cars cannot answer questions concern ing tht shape of car models an as is utilized for an  utteranct with erroneous objects or aspect incompatible properties and objects alw result in in as  this means that although both properties and objects are correct they cannot be used together to illustrate the action scheme consider utterance u l l what is the shape of hard fusta costuig 1 nowus  in figure 1 this will be interpreted is a task-related question  a qt with correctly specified objects parameter however tht aspect mibparameler is erroneous as there is no information in the database on the concept shape furthermore the system can not provide alter natives to the user thus the resulting action is an 1  s1 the next user utterance  u1  is- a qt with both correct objects  as copied from the previous ir-unit  and correct aspect sub-parameter  rust 1 hus the resulting action is an at  s1 
   it is not always possible to directly use the values in the objects and properties slots even if correctly specified for applications such as travel with hierarchi cally structured databases the dialogue manager some times needs to search the domain base or the dialogue tree to find an applicable object or property for instance  if the user in the dialogue in figure i asks for con cept information on properties associated with resorts  such as climate  when the hotels are m focus the domain model is utilized to find the appropriate resort 
　there are user initiatives which do not depend on the values of objects and properties  such as system-related questions  qs  i e the user requests information about the system these are recognized on the grounds of linguistic information provided by the syntactic/semantic analyzer  ahrenberg  1  
   if ordering is allowed it is important to know which task is currently being performed e xploring the database or ordering this problem has been discussed by for instance  ramshaw  l1l  and lambert and carberry  they present models using three different but interacting  levels of plans to know when users stop exploring different plane and instead commit themselves to one plan however a result emerging from the analy 
sis of our dialogues  jonsson 1a  is that the subjects clearly signal when the  change plan using utterances such as / would like to order a trip for two to lefkada thus retrieval of ordering information from tht use rs can be  collected in a formalized fashion controlled by the system  cf  hoeppner et a i 1

dialogue objects has been customized to meet the demands of the three systems discussed above cars and travel with and without ordering the customized di alogue objects for the cars system has also been integrated with an ingres database and interpreting niod ules using a grammar and a lexicon covering a subset of the ulterances found in the corpus a context free grammar with less than 1 rules can accurately model the dialogue structure  utilized in the corpus the principle of copying information from one dialogue object to the other provides the correct context for most referring expressions fot t ars onl  1% required a search in the dialogue tree the corresponding numbers for travei were 1% for information retrieval and 1% if ordering is utilized  for more details on the results from customizing the dialogue and focus structures see lonsson  l1a  and ahrenberg et al  l1   
　the action scheme presented in table 1 covers all taskrelated user initiatives utilized in the corpus in the cars application 1% of the us+r initiatives are task related questions in the travel application without or dering the number of task-related user initiatives account for 1% cf the user utti rances and dually when ordering is allowed 1% of the user utterances are task-related the other user initiatives are system related questions  farewells greetings  etc which art interpreted from lin guistic information thus a majority of the users lin tratives are task-related and will be handled efficiently and accliately using the action scheme 
1 	discussion 
the dialogue manager presented in this paper is re stricted to written human-computer interaction in nat ural language however when communicating with a natural language interface  a user should not be limited to typed keyboard input and screen output the possibilities of using various modalities must be addressed to further improve the interaction examples of sys-
jonsson 

terns which use a variety of modalities for both interpretation and generation include alfresco  stock  1   xtra  wahlster  1   voyager  zue  1  and cubri-
con  neal and shapiro  1  
　the main difference between multi-modal interfaces to simple service systems and conventional natural language interfaces to such applications is their ability to utilize a combination of input and output modali ties such as speech  graphics pointing and video output thus  more advanced interpretation and generation modules are required and principles for determining how to utilize each media are needed  arens tt al  1  
　however  the dialogue and focus structures need not neceasanly be more complicated for instance  voyager  zue  1  successfully utilizes the approach presented here of copying the focus parameters from one segment to the other  seneff  1  sitter and stein  present a model for dialogue management to information-seeking dialogues the model assumes that conversation is based on possible sequences of dialogue acts which are modeled in a transition network in stein an d thiel  the model is extended to handle multi-modal interaction as utilized in the merit system  stein tt al 1  
　thus  it seems that for simple service systems the dialogue model presented here will be sufficient not only for natural language interfaces but also interfaces utilizing various oilier modalities however  for task-oriented dialogues  where the user's task directs the dialogue  loo and bego  1   a model of this and the user's goals need to be consulted in order to provide user-friendly interaction  cf  burger and marshall  1   this does not imply the necessity  of a sophisticated  model based on the user's intentions utilizing a hierarchical struc ture of plans based on the various tasks possible to carry out in the domain might do just as well  cf  wahlster tt

natural language interaction will be more robust and habitable if the users can participate in a coherent dialogue with the system for natural language interfaces to information retrieval applications the necessary dialogue actions can be determined using a straightforward solution users specify a database object  or set of objects and ask tor domain concept information of that object or objects this is modeled in two parameters  one associated with the objects and another with the requested properties of that object the parameters are specified from information in the user initiative  the discourse and the background system and its domain model the ac tion to be carried out by the interface can be determined 
from the specification of these objects and properties parameters
