 
a beiiavioral theory of information processing based on ethological observations has been tested experimentally by programming a robot control system. the r e s u l t ant software has successfully simulated robot operation. three basic types of software modules are assumed as elements. these accept input s t i m u l i and generate detailed strings of motor response   u n i t s   to a t t a i n design goals. a complex process of i n t e r a c t i o n between the modules permits the consideration of many alternative actions while focusing attention on a selected set of input signals. ' the organi z a t i o n is shown to have especially f l e x i b l e characteristics adapted to robot cont r o l and permits a recursive d e f i n i t i o n of 1ome of the modules. brief comparisons with other robot systems in being indicate some of the relationships between the d i f -
ferent design approaches so far proposed. 
introduction 
the software for integrated robot design may be functionally divided into pattern recognition programs and control systems. control system programs analyze the environmental state data furnished by the pattern recognizers  i n i t i a t e decision processes  and issue motor commands intended to arrive at goal states. many d i f f e r e n t approaches have characterized the techniques used to arrive at decisions which generate sub-goals and produce detailed motor a c t i v i t y . 
the stanford research i n s t i t u t e and stanford university groups have stressed 
mathematical and engineering schema to solve these problems.1  1 a team from mit instrumentation labs  have simulated the hypotheses of a neurophysiological theory 1 . a control system model based on i n s t i n c t i v e behavior production principles is described here that provides s t i l l another viewpoint of the general problem of producing i n t e l l i gent behavior by machine. the rationale for r e l a t i n g animal behavior to this model is described elsewhere. 1 ethology  the study of animal behavior  has provided a mass of data on i n s t i n c t i v e or preprogrammed animal behavior. it has also introduced some t h e o r e t i c a l concepts that indicate there may w e l l be common features in the organ-
i z a t i o n of information processing at the i n s t i n c t i v e level through much of the animal kingdom from insects to mammals.1 in any event  the robot control model presented here has processing features which are divorced from the p a r t i c u l a r 
robot design inputs  the sensing elements  or the outputs  motor c a p a b i l i t i e s   . this permits a common system of control organization for widely d i f f e r i n g sensory capacities and motor repertoire. 
after describing the main characteristics of the system  i t s operation w i l l be compared with some of the other robot systems designs. the general strategy employed for finding a path through state space from i n i t i a l state to goal w i l l be d i s cussed. for a certain class of problems  this strategy offers advantages. 
to test the v a l i d i t y and usefulness of the model  a robot simulation was programmed in jovial on a philco 1 computer. as part of the simulation  a d i s play generated an animated cartoon in real time of the robot moving about in i t s environment  solving the problem s i t u a tions it encountered. in f a c t   a movie has been made of t y p i c a l robot a c t i v i t y . the simulation program is divided i n t o two parts. one part simulates the constantly changing environment; the other part is the robot control program  organized according to the hypothetical decision processes assumed in the behavioral theory1. the architecture of the computer program i t s e l f   while f a i t h f u l l y representing the behavior theory  introduces another assumption having nothing to do 
with behavior; i . e .   most of the i n f o r mation processing is carried on in ident i c a l modules or  equivalently  is assumed to be recursive. this formalization has implications for further development d i s cussed after the principles of organizat i o n are explained.

the decision and control function is performed by two groups of information processing modules called releasing mechanisms  rm's  and selectors of releasing mechanisms  srm's . the i n t e r n a l

activates the rm from which the largest signal came  thus selecting a hierarchy. a concrete example may c l a r i f y t h i s process. suppose the e x c i t i n g signals for nest building in figure 1 are  temperature below threshold  or  direct command  from a human controller and the e x c i t i n g signal for refueling is   f u e l level below a threshold . in this arrangement  we would design our signal to the srm from the  refueling  rm to be larger than the maximum signal from  nest building  before a dangerously low level of fuel was reached. then if the robot started with a f u l l gas tank and a command to construct a nest  i t would i n t e r r u p t i t s structure b u i l d i n g to engage in refueling when the analogue output signal to the srm from the  refueling  rm exceeded the corresponding signal from the  nest building  rm. 
the rm's at the top of the hierarchy are never blocked from receiving input signals  b u t   as figure 1 shows  each level of rm's below the top is blocked from receiving inputs u n t i l i t s superordinate rm is a c t i vated. once inputs are unblocked  however  the selection of an rm at the new level occurs in a fashion similar to the toplevel selection process  thus constituting a multi-layered pandemonium. as the a c t i vation of rm's descends  a level at a time  a new set of rm's is permitted to look for the p a r t i c u l a r patterns in the environment to which these rm's are ready to respond. if a l l goes well and the necessary patterns are found in the proper sequence  eventua l l y a terminating rm is reached and one or more motor control units are called 
which  by t h e i r operation  w i l l change the environmental s t a t e . when this happens  the whole process of searching through the e n t i r e hierarchy from the top level down is repeated  possibly activating a d i f f e r ent mcu and simulating p a r a l l e l operation of the hierarchies. 
provision must be made for unsuccessful performance of an mcu or a f a i l u r e to find the necessary environmental signals. when this occurs  it is necessary to back up in the hierarchy to attempt a pass through a d i f f e r e n t part of the tree structure. this backup is accomplished by a superordinate rm  monitoring i t s subordinate processors for success or f a i l u r e . if a f a i l u r e is detected from i t s subordinates a f t e r an rm is activated  the superordinate reduces i t s output to zero  regardless of i t s inputs  and a new choice is made at the superordinate l e v e l if one is possible. if no choice is available  the processing backs up s t i l l another l e v e l   clear up to the top if necessary. the top level is arranged so that it always finds a choice. an absence of external signals could cons t i t u t e a signal to enter a maintenance r o u t i n e   for example. an example of such 
a backup may be traced in figure 1 with the inputs defined in the previous example. suppose  nest building  is com-
manded and  seek nest site  has for an e x c i t i n g signal  has a proper s i t e been found   if the search strategy of t h i s rm is limited to a single sweep of the area  which is actually the case in our implementation  there might not be any s i t e found in this time that met the stored c r i t e r i a being sought. accordingl y   a f a i l u r e would be reported to  nest building  that would cause it to reduce the output signal to i t s srm to zero. the robot would then t r y refueling or maintenaxro depending on t h e i r r e l a t i v e e x c i t a t i o n s . 
a similar process of backup may take place if two rm's at the same level produce maximal outputs to the srm of exactly the same magnitude. if the outputs of the two rm's do not c o n f l i c t   both may be chosen for activation by the srm. if there is a c o n f l i c t possible  both may be suppressed and an alternative a c t i v i t y sought in the hierarchies. this phenomenon is actually observed in animals  and the circumstances under which it arises are described in the ethological l i t e r a ture r e l a t i n g to  displacement activity . 1 goal selection mechanism oppjratiqn 
a terminating rm  which may be at any level of the t r e e   calls a motor control unit or a terminating sub-routine. to do so however  the rm must be able to specify a l l the parameters needed to serve as a goal for the output procedure. for example  if the subroutine is  go to designated o b j e c t     and three or four objects possessing some of the required attributes are seen by the robot  some c r i t e r i o n must be used by the rm to select just one. the c r i t e r i o n might be   c l o sest  or  leftmost.  whatever the c r i t e r i o n   each rm must be able to examine goal determining inputs  not necessarily the same as the e x c i t i n g s t i m u l i which caused an output to the srm   and on the basis of these inputs  it must select the goal parameters needed to operate i t s subordinate data processors. this mechanism  i n t e r n a l to an rm  is called the goal selection mechanism  gsm . the process of generating subgoals has not been standardized. each rm may have a d i f f e r ent routine in i t s gsm. 
what is meant here may be i l l u s t r a t e d by some of the goal selection processes in the go to subroutine. the primary goal in the go to subroutine  once a prime t a r get has been selected  is a simple measure. the goal is attained if distance to target is less than a stored quantity  determined by the robots arm length .

selects them. thus  the designer can spec i f y an arbitrary hierarchy of stimulusresponse elements to solve any desired problem w i t h i n the constraints of the robot design capabilities for sensing and acting and he can do this with a minimum of i n s t r u c t i o n s . the operating system or executive w i l l c a l l the activated sets according to these instructions and automatically provide the p a r a l l e l multi-choice pandemonium hierarchies without further coding by the designer. 
an example of the kind of system design possible may be shown by two d i f f e r e n t arrangements of the  refuel  function as shown in figures 1a and 1b. the arrangement of figure 1a means that only a single top level threshold determines whether the robot w i l l engage in refueling a c t i v i t i e s   including searching for a gas s t a t i o n . the arrangement of figure 1b permits two thresholds. at the higher level of fuel state the robot w i l l refuel only if a gas station happens to be seen while it might be doing some tiling else. if this should not happen and fuel level continues to drop  the  seek gas station  rm w i l l then preempt other a c t i v i t y . 
besides branching and subroutines  the other programming element  looping  is readily accomplished by an appropriate hierarchical arrangement of rm's. a superordinate rm can specify a goal state not necessarily immediately attainable by the action of i t s subordinate rm's and mcu's. nevertheless  a chain of events can be specified at the subordinate level designed to accomplish part of the task at each pass and such that it is a c i r c u l a r chain; i . e .   actions at the end of the chain return the discriminable environment to the same state it was in at the beginning of the pass. for example  if the task is to p i l e objects at a p a r t i c u l a r place  the superordinate exciting condit i o n may be  less than 1 objects at   x   y     . this would cause subordinate rm's lo a c t i vate f i r s t a seeking behavior pattern in the environment and then fetching operations to  x y  for a f i r s t found object. once t h i s object was placed  the rm for i n i t i a t i n g search would be excited again  as  less than 1 objects at  x y   is s t i l l true. action would continue t i l l the goal state of six objects placed was reached. note that action is automatically discontinued once the robot has sensed that the goal state is attained even if the robot did not place the objects i t s e l f . 
a language for hierarchy assembly 
the present status of the system is such that the program designer must insert rm designations in a table provided  specify which rm's are subordinate to which by other tabular values  etc. the whole process is now formal enough to permit the construction of a special hierarchy assembly language with commands expressing concepts such as: 
add input stimulus xx to rm yy. 
rm ¡ê reports to rm a1 mcu bb reports to rm c. rm dd goal parameters go to subroutine rm ee  etc. 
such a specialized language is of course possible in any computer application whenever the use j u s t i f i e s the e f f o r t of w r i t i n g a t r a n s l a t o r   and the formal syntax can be specified. just such a use is foreseen in adding learning capabilities to the present system. 
an application to learning 
various forms of learning have been proposed to make programs behave i n t e l l i gently. samuel's method1 of changing weights has been the most successful to date  but it suffers from one defect common to a l l the really powerful a r t i f i c i a l intelligence programs so far im-
plemented. namely  the features or cues from the environment to which adjusted weights are applied must be recognized and supplied by the human program designer. 
suppose a learning program devoted  among other things  to determining previously unknown cues from the environment can be designed to operate in conjunction with a substrate of   i n s t i n c t i v e   s t a r t i n g capab i l i t i e s . in other words  the robot has enough b u i l t in capability to give it a chance to learn. once the learning mechanism had determined a new cue  it would have the task of modifying the i n s t i n c t structure to incorporate this new input s i g n a l . if the learning mechanism had a hierarchy assembly language available and a translator in operation for executing a chosen assembly command  such f a c i l i t i e s would permit e f f i c i e n t handling of this part of the t o t a l learning task. 
there remains the d i f f i c u l t job of selecting the r i g h t command. it should not 
be necessary to resort to random mechanisms such as friedberg used to do t h i s . 1 the context in which a new cue is i s o l a ted w i l l furnish h e u r i s t i c pointers i dentifying with some l i k e l i h o o d the rm to which it might be associated. for example  l e t us assume that a constant association in time takes place between a previously unknown cue and one that is known because it is already used to exc i t e an rm. such an association makes that rm a l i k e l y candidate for adding on

the newly discovered cue. in s h o r t   cons t r a i n t s are sought i n s y n t a c t i c r e l a t i o n ships between the unknown and various elements of the e x i s t i n g h i e r a r c h y as determined by i n t e r a c t i o n s w i t h the e n v i r o n -
ment. only s e l e c t i o n of such commands w i l l be attempted as can be reasonably c o n s t r a i n e d to a l i m i t e d s e t of p o s s i b i l i t i e s . 
present status 
at p r e s e n t   minimal use is made by the i n s t i n c t system of updated i n t e r n a l memory. on the o t h e r hand the s t a t e of the ext e r n a l environment i t s e l f is used as a k i n d of memory of what the next a c t i o n should be. this f e a t u r e i s r e f l e c t e d i n i n s t i n c t i v e animal behavior and was long ago noted by the e t h o l o g i s t s 1 . it obviously r e s u l t s in a g r e a t economy of memory. 
because no planning programs have been implemented as y e t   the s t r a t e g i e s a v a i l able to the present system are s e q u e n t i a l ; i . e .   the robot t a c k l e s the environmental s t a t e i n i t s immediate neighborhood  acts o n i t   considers the r e s u l t a n t s t a t e   e t c . there is almost no look-ahead. on the other hand  the system e x h i b i t s considerable f l e x i b i l i t y and a d a p t a b i l i t y cons i d e r i n g the r i g i d s t r a t e g i e s i t must now employ. for example  the robot f i l m shows a s e a r c h - f e t c h sequence in which adroit* sets out to p i c k up a n e s t b u i l d i n g o b j e c t . when a s i m i l a r o b j e c t i s placed d i r e c t l y i n f r o n t o f i t   adroit changes g o a l s   stops moving towards the previous t a r g e t o b j e c t and immediately p i c k s up the newly presented one. this happens because a l l g o a l obj e c t s i n the f i e l d o f view are being r e viewed f o r o p t i m a l i t y and the c l o s e s t becomes the prime t a r g e t . s i m i l a r l y any g o a l s t a t e s s p e c i f i e d in the rm h i e r a r c h y and in a   s t a t e - o f - b e i n g   before motor a c t i o n is i n i t i a t e d are detected and 
motor a c t i o n t o get t o those s t a t e s i s suppressed a c c o r d i n g l y . this r e s u l t s i n  behavior  most u n l i k e t h a t of an o r d i nary machine  and of the k i n d normally associated w i t h animals. 
this suppression of motor a c t i o n u s u a l l y taken by the program is an example of  unplanned  branching which i s t y p i c a l o f adroit's f u n c t i o n i n g . we may regard the subordinate rm's in the t r e e s t r u c t u r e and the mcu sequences they produce as planned branches or jumps from a supero r d i n a t e rm. any time the program dep a r t s from a normal s t r i n g of mcu's and i n s t e a d produces an mcu s t r i n g associated w i t h a h i g h e r or lower l e v e l of the given h i e r a r c h y or a completely d i f f e r e n t h i e r archy  t h i s may be denoted as  unplanned . 
i t i s c h a r a c t e r i s t i c o f the program i n operation t h a t i t s a c t i o n i s f u l l o f such jumps. it has been our experience t h a t once the program is debugged  these jumps appear a p p r o p r i a t e l y n a t u r a l and   l i f e l i k e   . 
assumptions about pattern recognition 
the most ambitious of the robot c o n s t r u c t i o n programs to date is the sri p r o j e c t . the p r o j e c t has focused on a c t u a l hardware r a t h e r than s i m u l a t i o n and has already achieved notable progress. it has developed some e l a b o r a t e p a t t e r n r e c o g n i t i o n programs  p a r t i c u l a r l y f o r the v i s u a l sense. table 1 shows a comparison between the sensory and motor systems developed by sri and the assumptions about p a t t e r n r e c o g n i t i o n c a p a b i l i t i e s o f the simulated adroit systems. 
the mccarthy p r o j e c t at stanford univers i t y and the minsky - papert arm and eye p r o j e c t at mit have made considerable p r o gress i n v i s u a l p a t t e r n r e c o g n i t i o n p r o blems  as w e l l as arm c o o r d i n a t i o n sensing and motor adjustment. a g r e a t e r p a t t e r n r e c o g n i t i o n c a p a b i l i t y than assumed f o r adroit's arm has been implemented by these teams.

the sri p r o j e c t has already made use of powerful mapping and p l a n n i n g techniques w i t h great success. n e v e r t h e l e s s   sri has 
introduced programs using unplanned se-

the mit i n s t r u m e n t a t i o n laboratory p r o j e c t which is designing a robot f o r unmanned e x p l o r a t i o n of mars  has .simulated a n e u r o p h y s i o l o g i c a l theory of o p e r a t i o n ol: the r e t i c u l a r formation f o r i t s d e c i s i o n making system. this model appears to serve the same f u n c t i o n as choosing a major goal h i e r a r c h y in the adroit beh a v i o r a l model.
