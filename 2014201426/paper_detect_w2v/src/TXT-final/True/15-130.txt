 
during most of the l a s t two decades  computational l i n g u i s t s and ai researchers working on n a t u r a l language have assumed that phrase s t r u c t u r e grammars  despite t h e i r computational t r a c t a b i l i t y   were u n s a t i s f a c t o r y devices for expressing the syntax of n a t u r a l languages  however  during the same p e r i o d   they have come to r e a l i z e that transformational grammars  whatever t h e i r l i n g u i s t i c m e r i t s   are computationally i n t r a c t a b l e as they stand. the assumption  unchallenged for many years  that psg's were inadequate for n a t u r a l languages is based on arguments o r i g i n a l l y advanced by transformational l i n g u i s t s in the l a t e 1 s and e a r l y 1's. but recent work has shown that none of those arguments were v a l i d . the present paper draws on that work to argue that   i   there is no reason  at the present time  to think that n a t u r a l languages are not c o n t e x t - f r e e languages    i i   there are good reasons to t h i n k that the notations needed to capture s i g n i f i c a n t s y n t a c t i c g e n e r a l i z a t i o n s w i l l characterize phrase s t r u c t u r e grammars or some minor g e n e r a l i z a t i o n of them  and   i i i   there are good reasons for b e l i e v i n g t h a t such grammars  and the monostratal representations they induce  provide the necessary basis f o r the semantic i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of natural languages. if these arguments are v a l i d   then the prospects f o r a f r u i t f u l i n t e r a c t i o n between t h e o r e t i c a l l i n g u i s t i c s and ai are much b r i g h t e r than they would otherwise be. 
	i 	introduction 
consider the f o l l o w i n g q u o t a t i o n s : 
as already mentioned  a c o n t e x t - f r e e phrase s t r u c t u r e grammar is not s u f f i c i e n t to describe or analyze the whole range of s y n t a c t i c constructions which occur in n a t u r a l language texts   c f . chomsky 1 . even if one disregards the t h e o r e t i c a l l i n g u i s t ' s demand f o r s a t i s f a c t o r y d e s c r i p t i o n s of the s y n t a c t i c s t r u c t u r e of sentences  there are strong reasons to design a more powerful parser than the one described above. 
cases in point are the phenomenon of agreement w i t h i n noun phrases  the correspondence in the verb phrase between the form of the main verb and the type of the a u x i l i a r y   and subject verb agreement. the argument s t r u c t u r e of p r e d i c a t e s   t h a t i s   t h e i r various types o f objects and complements  represents another kind of c o n t e x t - s e n s i t i v i t y in n a t u r a l language. . . . the best strategy seems to be to take care of the p a r t i c u l a r types of c o n t e x t - s e n s i t i v i t y recognized by l i n g u i s t i c theory by means of special procedures which act as a superstructure of the algorithm for c o n t e x t - f r e e a n a l y s i s . . . . in a d d i t i o n to the above-mentioned drawbacks a c o n t e x t - f r e e 
phrase s t r u c t u r e grammar has d i f f i c u l t y handling word order v a r i a t i o n in a n a t u r a l way. 
	 welin 	1: 	1  
one s i g n i f i c a n t -use of the general c o n t e x t free methods is as part of a system of processing n a t u r a l languages such as english. we are not suggesting that there is a c o n t e x t - f r e e grammar for e n g l i s h . it is probably more appropriate to view the grammar/parser as a convenient c o n t r o l s t r u c t u r e for d i r e c t i n g the analysis of the input s t r i n g . the o v e r a l l analysis is motivated by a l i n g u i s t i c model which is not context f r e e   but which can f r e q u e n t l y make use of s t r u c t u r e s determined by the c o n t e x t free grammar. 
 graham  harrison & ruzzo 1: 1  
these two passages have a number of things in common  of which three are relevant here. f i r s t l y   the issue of whether n a t u r a l languages 
 nl's  are c o n t e x t - f r e e languages  cfl's  and are susceptible to analysis by c o n t e x t - f r e e phrase s t r u c t u r e grammars  cf-psg's  is one the authors take to be relevant to parsing. secondly  both passages assume that t h i s issue has already been r e s o l v e d   and resolved in the negative. t h i r d l y   i did not have to look f o r them  i merely bumped i n t o them  as it were  in the course of recent reading. however  i am sure that if i had been in the business of f i n d i n g passages w i t h t h i s kind of f l a v o u r in the parsing l i t e r a t u r e of the past 1 years  then i could have found dozens  probably hundreds. 
the purpose of the present paper is simply to draw the a t t e n t i o n of computational l i n g u i s t s to the f a c t that the issue of the status of nl's w i t h respects to the cfl's and cf-psg's is not r e s o l v e d   and to the f a c t that a l l the published arguments seeking to e s t a b l i s h that nl's are not cfl's  or that cf-psg's are not adequate f o r the analysis of nl's  are completely without f o r c e . of course  t h i s does not e n t a i l that nl's are cfl's or that cf-psg's c o n s t i t u t e the appropriate 
formal theory of nl grammars. but it does have as a consequence that computational linguists should not just give up on cf-psg's on the grounds that theoretical linguistics has demonstrated their inadequacy. no such demonstration exists. 
in assessing whether some formal theory of grammar is an adequate theory for nl's  at least the following three criteria are relevant  and have been historically.  i  does it permit nl's qua sets of strings to be generated    i i   does it permit significant generalizations to be expressed    i i i   does it support a semantics  that i s   does it provide a basis on which meanings can be assigned to nl expressions in a satisfactory manner  
in the remainder of this paper  i shall consider these three criteria in turn with reference to the adequacy of cf-psg's as grammars for nl's. the issues are large  and space is limited  so my discussion will take the form  for the most part  of annotated references to the literature where the various issues are properly dealt with. 
	ii 	generating natural language string sets 
the belief that cf-psg's cannot cope with syntactic concord and long-distance dependencies  and hence that nl's are not cfl's  but  say  properly context-sensitive languages  is well entrenched. one textbook goes so far as to assert that 'the grammatical phenomenon of subject predicate agreement is sufficient to guarantee the accuracy of  the statement that  english is not a cf-psg language'  grinder & elgin 1: 1 . the phenomenon guarantees no such thing  of course. nor is the character of the problem changed when agreement is manifested across unbounded distances in strings  pace bach 1: 1  bresnan 1: 1 . indeed  finite state languages can exhibit such dependencies  see pullum & gazdar  1 . 
the introductory texts and similar expository works in the field of generative grammar offer nothing that could be taken seriously as an argument that nl's are not cfl's. however  five putatively non-specious arguments to this effect are to be found in the more technical literature. these are based on the following phenomena: 
 a  english comparative clauses  chomsky 1: 1   
 b  the decimal expansion of pi 
 elster 1: 1   
 c  'respectively' 
 bar-hillel & shamir 1: 1  langendoen 1: 1   
 d  dutch subordinate clauses  huybregts 1    e  mohawk noun incorporation  postal 1 . 
pullum & gazdar  1  show that  a  is based on a false empirical claim and a false claim about formal languages   b  has no bearing on english or any other natural language since it depends on a 
confusion between grammar and arithmetic   c  is based on a false empirical claim  and the facts  
g. gazdar 1 
such as they are  are relevant to semantics rather than syntax in any case   d  provides no basis for any string set argument   and  e  postal crucially failed to take account of one class of permissible incorporations - once these are recognized  the formal basis of his argument collapses. 
thus  pullum & gazdar  1  demonstrate that every published argument purporting to show that one or another nl is not a cfl is invalid  either formally  or empirically  or both. whether any nl  construed as a string set  falls outside the class of cfls remains an open question  just as it was twenty five years ago. 
	i l l 	capturing significant generalizations 
argumentation purporting to show that cf-psg's w i l l miss significant generalizations about some nl phenomenon has been woefully inadequate. 
typically it consists simply of providing or alluding to some cf-psg which obviously misses the generalization in question. but  clearly  nothing whatever follows from such an exhibition. any framework capable of handling some phenomenon at a l l will typically make available indefinitely many ugly analyses of the phenomenon. but this fact is neither surprising nor interesting. what is surprising  and rather disturbing  is that arguments of this kind  beginning  classically  in chapter 1 of chomsky 1  have been taken so seriously for so long. 
capturing significant generalizations is largely a matter of notation. but cf-psg's  taken as a 
class of mathematical objects  have properties which are theirs independently of the notations that might be used to define them. thus they determine a certain set of string sets  they determine a certain set of tree sets  they stand in particular equivalence relations  and so on. an analogy from logic is pertinent here: the truth function material implication just is material implication whether you notate it with an arrow  or a hook  or the third letter of the alphabet  and whether you use prefix  i n f i x   or postfix positioning of the symbol. 
over its 1 year history  transformational grammar developed a whole armoury of linguistically useful notations  and many of these can just as well be used in characterizing cf-psg's. three such notational devices merit individual mention:  a  complex symbols   b  rule schemata  and  c  mappings from one set of rules into another 
 metarules . 
harman  1  deserves the credit for f i r s t seeing the potential of psg's incorporating complex symbols. the use of a finite set of complex symbols  in place of the traditional finite set of monadic symbols  leaves the mathematical properties of cf-psg's unchanged. every cf-psg employing complex symbols generates a tree set that is isomorphic to the tree set generated by some cf-psg not employing complex symbols. however  complex symbol systems including features   x-bar conventions   and  slash 

1 	g. gazdar 
categories   etc.  allow many significant syntactic generalizations to be captured rather straightforwardly. 
for example  gazdar & pullum  1  show 	how 	the transfer  the head feature convention  see gazdar 1  suffices to capture a l l the straightforward facts about subject verb agreement in english. 
figure 1 illustrates: use of complex symbols for subcategorization in a cf-psg can capture generalizations that had had to be stipulated in the standard transformational account employing context-sensitive lexical insertion. and in gazdar  1a  1b  and sag  1a  1b  complex symbols called  slash categories  are shown to be able to capture the generalizations underlying the class of unbounded dependency constructions in english  e.g. relative clauses  wh-questions  topicalization  etc. . figure 1 illustrates with a topicalization example: 
indeed  as borsley  1  and stucky  1  appendix  demonstrate  far more subtle and complex agreement phenomena succumb to analysis by phrase structure grammars equipped with features and rule schemata. 
like a rule schema  a metarule is a grammar characterization device   i . e . a clause in the definition of the grammar . but unlike a rule schema  it is one which enables one to define one set of rules in terms of another set  antecedently given. generalizations which would be lost if the two sets of rules were merely listed are captured by the metarule . 
for example  suppose that our grammar contains  inter alia  the following set of rules expanding 
vp: 
interestingly  such an analysis of unbounded dependencies is able to capture a generalization about their interaction with coordination that was never satisfactorily captured in transformational grammar  see gazdar  pullum  sag & wasow 1 . 
rule schemata allow generalizations to be captured by collapsing sets of rules with some common property into a single statement. in a cf-psg  one can capture the familiar generalization that only like-constituents conjoin with a schema along the following lines: 
the generalization that this captures was not captured in classical tg: part of it was expressed in the base rules  and the rest was intendedly expressed in the formulation of a transformation called  coordination reduction . 
another example of 	the 	power 	of 	rule 	schemata  applied 	to 	complex 	symbols  involves agreement phenomena: 
where $ ranges over permissible 
combinations of agreement features. 
this schema  taken together with a widely assumed  and putatively univeral  convention of feature 

note that transformations were mappings from sets of s t r u c t u r e s to sets of s t r u c t u r e s   whereas metarules are mappings from sets of rules to sets of r u l e s . gazdar & sag  1  and gunji  1  show how metarules can capture r e f l e x i v e pronoun g e n e r a l i z a t i o n s in the d e f i n i t i o n s of psg's for english and japanese  r e s p e c t i v e l y   and gazdar  pullum & sag  1  use metarules to provide accurate and nonredundant analyses for  subjecta u x i l i a r y i n v e r s i o n     adverb placement  and vp e l l i p s i s in a grammar of the english a u x i l i a r y system. 
so-called   f r e e word order  languages have sometimes been alleged to pose a problem in p r i n c i p l e for the g e n e r a l i z a t i o n - c a p t u r i n g powers of cf-psg's. that they do not is amply demonstrated in horrocks  1   pullum  1  and stucky  1    1   . 
there i s   thus  at the present time  no reason whatsoever to think that the goal of capturing l i n g u i s t i c a l l y s i g n i f i c a n t generalizations i s i n any way inconsistent with the use of cf-psg's. 
	iv  	support of a  semantics 
in asking whether some theory of syntax  supports a semantics   we are asking whether there e x i s t s some semantic theory which w i l l i n t e r p r e t the s t r u c t u r e s provided by the syntax in a manner consistent with our judgments concerning ambiguity  synonymy  entailment  e t c . within l i n g u i s t i c s   the key semantic development of the 1's was the appearance of a model theory for n a t u r a l languages o r i g i n a t i n g in the work of montague  see montague 1; dowty et a l . 1 . before montague  l i n g u i s t s had been disposed e i t h e r to do t h e i r semantics in the syntax  a practice that reached i t s apogee in the work of the generative semanticists  or not at a l l   as in chomsky's oeuvres. but the sophisticated machinery   i n c l u d i n g lambda a b s t r a c t i o n   meaning p o s t u l a t e s   higher order q u a n t i f i c a t i o n   intension and extension operators  e t c .   which montague had made a v a i l a b l e meant that semantics could now be done as such. this had a l l kinds of i m p l i c a t i o n s f o r syntax. 
here are some examples  	  i   heny  1  and cooper 
 1  showed that q u a n t i f i e r scope ambiguities could be handled e n t i r e l y in the semantics  without the need for q u a n t i f i e r movement in the syntax. more r e c e n t l y   cooper  1  has provided a general semantic treatment of pronouns and q u a n t i f i e r binding which d i r e c t l y i n t e r p r e t s a phrase s t r u c t u r e syntax    i i   dowty  1  showed that the semantic properties of d a t i v e   passive  unapeoified o b j e c t     r a i s i n g     and  equi  constructions could a l l be provided for d i r e c t l y   without corresponding syntactic operations that moved or deleted np's.   i i i   also in 1  three sets of authors independently proposed closely r e l a t e d c r o s s - c a t e g o r i a l semantic theories for coordination  cooper 1; gazdar 1a; keenan & f a l t z 1 . this work  which is f u r t h e r advanced in partee & rooth  1   completely undercuts a l l semantic motivation for  coordination reduction  transformations or equivalent operations in the 
g. gazdar 1 
syntax    i v   mccloskey  1  was able to show that the deep s t r u c t u r e / s u r f a c e s t r u c t u r e d i s t i n c t i o n was i r r e l e v a n t to g i v i n g a semantics for r e l a t i v e clauses and wh-questions: s t r u c t u r e s of e i t h e r kind provide a s u i t a b l e locus for semantic i n t e r p r e t a t i o n    v  klein  1  1a  1b  1  has demonstrated that the meaning of a l l the various comparative constructions found in english can be derived d i r e c t l y from t h e i r surface syntactic forms as given by a cf-psg along the l i n e s of gazdar  1b .   v i   wasow  sag  & nunberg  1  argue that the proper treatment of idioms is one which semantically i n t e r p r e t s them compositionally. their analysis v i t i a t e s a l l the arguments for syntactic movement rules that depend on the claim that sentences l i k e tabs were kept on every suspect cannot be compositionally i n t e r p r e t e d . in a s i m i l a r v e i n   sag  1c  and sag 1 klein  1  have shown that the s y n t a c t i c d i s t r i b u t i o n of the english  dummy subjects  it and there  as in such sentences as it appears to be obvious that we l o s t   and there seems to have been a l i o n in the park  follow from an appropriate semantic theory of such expressions  without any need for r a i s i n g operations in the syntax.   v i i   and  in related work  klein & sag  1  develop a semantic theory for phrase s t r u c t u r e grammars for natural languages which l a r g e l y eliminates the need to s t i p u l a t e semantic t r a n s l a t i o n r u l e s . instead  these rules f o l l o w from a f u n c t i o n which takes as arguments  1  the semantic type of a l e x i c a l item  and  1  the phrase s t r u c t u r e rule responsible for introducing the l e x i c a l item. 
thus there is every reason to believe that cfpsg's can support appropriate semantic theories for nl's at least as well as m u l t i l e v e l s y n t a c t i c frameworks  1  1     indeed  there is an ad hominem argument which suggests that they may be p r e f e r a b l e . i t i s noteworthy that almost a l l the l i n g u i s t s c u r r e n t l y working out the i m p l i c a t i o n s of montague's semantic legacy   e . g . bach  cooper  dahl  dowty  karttunen  keenan  k l e i n   partee  peters  and sag  to name but ten  have g r a v i t a t e d 
towards e s s e n t i a l l y monostratal s y n t a c t i c theories although t h i s concreteness is not obviously presaged in montague's own  rather a b s t r a c t   approach to syntax. 
	1 	conclusions 
in b r i e f   i have t r i e d to make p l a u s i b l e the f o l l o w i n g three claims    i   there is no reason  at the present time  to t h i n k that nl's are not cfl's.   i i   there are good reasons for t h i n k i n g that the notations that we need to capture significant s y n t a c t i c g e n e r a l i z a t i o n s w i l l characterize cf-psg's  or some minor g e n e r a l i z a t i o n of them  such as indexed grammars    i i i   there are very good reasons for believing that such grammars  and the monostratal representations they induce  provide the necessary basis f o r the semantic i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of nl's. and t h a t   concomitantly  there is no semantic motivation f o r s y n t a c t i c operations that move  d e l e t e   permute  copy or s u b s t i t u t e c o n s t i t u e n t s . 
the relevance of these claims  which 	emerge 	from

abstract 
learning theory is the study of systems that implement functions from evidential states to theories. the theoretical framework developed in the theory makes possible the comparison of classes of algorithms which embody distinct learning strategies along a variety of dimensions. such comparisons yield valuable information to those concerned with inference problems in cognitive science and a r t i f i c i a l intelligence. 
the present paper employs the framework of learning theory to study the design specifications of inductive systems which are of interest in the domain of language acquisition. 
section 1: introduction 
　　　learning theory is tho investigation of systems that implement functions from evidential states to theories. of central concern is the characterization of conditions under which such functions stabilize to accurate theories of a given environment. within the theory  the informal notions of  evidence    theory    stabilization    accuracy   and  environment  are replaced by precise definitions. alternative formulations of these concepts yield alternative models within the theory. the vigorous development of learning 
theory began with a celebrated paper by 
gold  1 . angluin & smith  1  provide a valuable review of formal results. 
　　　learning theory is motivated by both scientific and technological concerns. scientifically  the theory has proved useful in the analysis of human learning  particularly  language acquisition  see osherson  stob & weinstein  forthcoming  for a review of issues . technologically  the theory helps specify what is learnable 1n principle  and may thus guide the construction of practical systems of inductive inference. 
　　　learning theory yields potentially valuable insights about problems of inductive inference in the context of cognitive science and a r t i f i c i a l intelligence. the theory provides the framework for systematic comparison of various learning algorithms. such comparisons are particularly useful in determining the relative strength of classes of algorithms which embody distinct abstract learning strategies  in assessing their resource requirements  and in predicting their behavior in various environments. when combined with empirical studies of language acquisition  learning theory may provide constraints on the character of the learning strategies implemented by children  and reflect in turn on the character of the class of languages which may be acquired. such studies in cognitive science may be of importance to system builders in a r t i f i c i a l intelligence. they suggest that the search for ideal learning strategies' is not well motivated. rather  by focussing on learners who embody different  styles  of learning  and by investigating their properties  the theory allows a comparison of the optimality of distinct approaches to learning along a multitude of dimensions. in addition  through the analysis of classes of algorithms that embody distinct learning strategies  this theoretical framework may provide a useful complement to studies of ad hoc systems built to perform inductive inference in problem domains of limited 
scope. 
　　　the present paper reviews some of our recent work on practical inference and relates it to problems in language acquisition. we consider design specifications for inductive systems relevant to  a  the speed of inference  
 b  the simplicity of inferred theories   c  the likelihood of inferential success  and  d  the resilience of such systems in environments subject to informational imperfection. attention 

is r e s t r i c t e d to learning paradigms in which only   p o s i t i v e i n f o r m a t i o n   is a v a i l a b l e about the language or data-set to be i n f e r r e d ; d i r e c t information about nonmembership is not offored to the learner; angluin & smith  1  survey results relevant to learning paradigms in which both p o s i t i v e and negative information is assumed a v a i l a b l e . 
　　　our exposition is organized as f o l l o w s . the next section provides d e f i n i t i o n s and construals at the heart of contemporary learning theory. section 1 e x h i b i t s theorems proper to the topics  a  -  d  l i s t e d above. proofs of these theorems can be found in 
osherson  	stob 	& 	weinstein 	 1

	1.1 	efficiency 
　　　let i c re 1  and let h be a total recursive function. Φi is said to identify l h-efficientlyy just in case   i   Φi identifies l text efficiently with respect to f r e c  in particular  Φi identifies l   and   i i   Φj is h-time efficient for l. h-efficiency  that is. combines the virtues of text efficiency  with respect to f r e c   and h-time efficiency. the next proposition shows that  for any h  h-efficiency is more restrictive than text efficiency as a design feature of recursive learning functions. 
　　　proposition 1: for every total recursive function  h  there is a collection  l  of languages such that   i   some f  frec identifies l text efficiently  but   i i   no Φ  frec identifies l h-efficiently. 
　　　proposition 1: for some total recursive function  h  there is l c re such that   i   some f  f r e c identifies l text efficiently    i i   some Φi identifies l h-time efficiently  but   i i i   no Φj identifies l h-efficiently. 
1 simple conjectures 
　　　to be useful  a learner should not only converge rapidly to a correct theory of its environment  it should also converge to a relatively simple theory: excessively complex theories  even if true  are of l i t t l e practical use. to study the impact of such simplicity constraints on learnability  a total recursive size measure  s:n -  n  is now imposed on our acceptable ordering of partial recursive functions. intuitively  s may be conceived as mapping indices to sizes  s i  being the length of the program for Φ1 corresponding to index i. the measure is governed by the following two axioms  
due to blum  1b . 
　　　axiom 1: for all i  n  there are only f i n i t e l y many j  n such that s j  ＊ i. 
	axiom 	1: 	the 	predicate 	 j 	 
s   l  1    for i f j  n  is decidable. 
d. osherson et al. 1 
　　　define the function ms:＜re -  n as follows. for l  re  re l  
uj  1k  wk = l & s k  = j   . thus  ms l  is the size of the smallest program that accepts l. concern about simple conjectures may take the following form. let g be a total recursive function  let f  f  and let l c re. f is said to identify l g-s1mply just in case f identifies l  and for all t  tl  f converges on t to an index  j  such that s j    g ms rng t  . to exemplify  let g be  x.1x. then f identifies l g-simply just in case f identifies l  and for all l  l and t  tl  f converges on t to an index of size no greater than twice ms l   the size of the smallest program that accepts l * rng t  . 
　　　text efficiency and g-simplicity are more restrictive design features of recursive learning functions than either is alone. this is the content of the 
next proposition. 
　　　proposition 1: there is l c re such that  i  some f  f r e c identifies l text efficiently    i i   for any total recursive function  g  such that g x    x for all x  n  some f  f r e c identifies l g-simply  but   i i i   for every f  f r e c   and every total 
recursive function  h  if f identifies l text efficiently with respect to f r e c   then f does not identify l h-simply. 
1 learning in likely environments'1 
　　　in some environments each potential element of a language is associated with a 	fixed 	probability 	of 	occurrence  invariant 	through 	time. 	such environments 	may 	be 	thought 	of 	as infinite 	sequences 	of 	stochastically independent events  the probability of a 
given element  e  appearing in the n+lst position 	being 	independent 	of 	the contents of positions 1 through n. 
to study such environments  each l 
 re is associated with a probability measure* m  on n such that for all x  n  x  l if and only 1f ml {x}    1. 
 recall that every l  re 1s nonempty; see section 1.  next  we impose on 
tre
    its baire topology  re; that 1s  for each a  seq  we take bg ＊ {t  
t	a
 1bsl 	is 	in 	t 	to 	basic 	open set of f re. for each l  r♀  we define the 



sentences have been removed. texts for l count as incomplete texts for l. we say that a learning function  f. identifies a language  l  on incomplete text just in case f converges to an index for l on every incomplete text for l. identifiability of collections of languages on incomplete text is defined straightforwardly. 
　　　proposition 1: there is a collection  l  of languages such that  a  every language in l is infinite and disjoint from every other language in l   b  some recursive learning function identifies 1  and  c  no recursive learning function identifies l on incomplete text. 

　　　given the margin of error tolerated in finite-difference identification  one might doubt that imperfection restricts this kind of learning. it is thus natural to conjecture: 
l is finite-difference identifiable  by recursive learning function  if and only if 1 is finite-difference identifiable on noisy text  by recursive learning function ; and 
	d. osherson et al. 	1 
l is finite-difference identifiable  by recursive learning function  if and only if l is finite-difference identifiable on incomplete text  by recursive learning function . 
the next two propositions show that both versions of both conjectures are false. 
　　　proposition 1: there is a collection  l  of languages such that some recursive learning function identifies l  but no learning function  recursive or not  finite-difference identifies l on noisy text. 
　　　proposition 1: there 1s a collection  jl  of languages such that some recursive learning function identifies l  but no learning function  recursive or not  finite-difference identifies l on incomplete text. 
section 1: language acquisition and formal models of inference 
　　　the circumstances of normal language acquisition by children appear to share a fundamental feature with the inference paradigms discussed above. infants apparently have no direct access to the nonsentences  so labeled  of the target language. this assertion rests on evidence that children are seldom corrected for ungrammatical utterances per se  nor do they communicate more successfully with grammatical than with ungrammatical sentences  brown & hanlon  1 . in short  children learn their language on texts. 
　　　as a consequence of this shared environmental feature  the propositions adduced above are relevant to the study of language acquisition. thus:  a  propositions 1 - 1 reveal some of the consequences of efficient learning by children; if language acquisition proceeds efficiently in the senses earlier defined  the class of learnable languages is narrower on this account   b  if the class of natural languages is i n f i n i t e   then a corollary of results in section 1 shows that i n f i n i t e l y many grammars conjectured by children are wildly oversized  by any reasonable measure of size    c  if each sentence in the target language can be associated 
with a lower bound on the probability of its occurrence in the child's linguistic environment  then proposition 1 shows 

that the set of languages that can be learned with certainty is very large. and  d  propositions 1 and 1 reveal the surprising consequences for language acquisition of even mild imperfections in children's linguistic environments. these kinds of connections between 
formal learning theory and language acquisition by children have become increasingly central to linguistic theory and developmental psycholinguistics  see wexler & 
culicover  	1; 	osherson  	stob 	& 
weinstein 1a . 
　　　the results reviewed in this paper represent only one of several perspectives on language acquisition offered by formal learning theory. thus  in addition to efficiency  soveral other learning strategies plausibly attributed to children have been investigated from the learning theoretic point of view  osherson  stob & weinstein 1b . these include such response tendencies as  a  restriction to hypotheses compatible with available data   b  gradual shifts in hypotheses rather than large leaps   c  perseveration on conjectures that predict the available linguistic data   d  restriction to grammars with nontrivial  recursive  rules  and  e  exclusion of long-past data in hypothesis selection. additionally  criteria of successful acquisition less stringent than identification have been formulated and studied in the context of contemporary linguistic theory and language acquisition. these issues are discussed in osherson & weinstein
