1 introduction
in the past few years max-sat solving techniques have drawn increasing attention  gramm et al.  1; de givry et al.  1; alsinet et al.  1; shen and zhang  1; li et al.  1; 1; larrosa and heras  1; xing and zhang  1; heras and larrosa  1  in various fields of artificial intelligence  because many problems can be handled by transforming an original problem instance into a maxsat instance and solving it with a max-sat solver. these problemsincludemax-cut  max-clique  as well as problems in domains such as routing  xu et al.  1   bioinformatics  strickland et al.  1   scheduling  vasquez and hao  1   and probabilistic reasoning  park  1 .
¡¡max-sat is an optimization version of the sat problem. in the last decade significant progress has been made in the performance of sat solvers. a modern sat solver can handle instances containing up to a million variables within rea-

¡¡¡¡  this work has been supported by the australian research council grant dp1  national basic research 1 program of china under grant 1cb1  national natural science foundation of china grants 1  1 and 1  and guangdong provincial natural science foundation grants 1 and 1.   corresponding authorsonable time  kautz and selman  1 . almost every complete sat solveris based on the dpll algorithm  davis et al.  1   and almost every dpll-based solver employs transformation rules  such as unit propagation and resolution  to achieve high efficiency. such rules improve sat solvers in two main aspects. first  it may be used to simplify a formula. second  at each internal node of the search tree  the solver may attempt to use such rules to prove unsatisfiability of the formula instantiated by a partial assignment  and if the formula is really unsatisfiable  the solver will not extend the partial assignment any more. although such rules are of great use in sat solving  it can not be applied directly to maxsat solvers for several reasons. first  using these rules to simplify a formula may not preserve the optimal value. second  since the goal of a max-sat solver is to find maximum number of satisfied clauses  the proof of unsatisfiability is meaningless. this is why there is a big gap between sat and max-sat solving. fortunately  transformation rules can be used to compute lower bounds during the max-sat searching process. in this paper  we further study the properties of transformation rules for  weighted  max-sat and propose several new rules to improve the lower bounds.
¡¡due to the differences between the logic behind the maxsat problemand that behind sat   larrosaand heras  1  developed a logical framework to extend the sat solving techniques to max-sat. however  because of the simplicity of this framework  we can not study the properties of the transformation rules intensively. in order to avoid this limitation  we extend the framework by introducing several new fundamental concepts.
¡¡this paper is organized as follows. in section 1  we describe our logical framework for max-sat  and intensively study the properties of inference rules. in section 1  we propose several new inference rules to improve max-sat solvers. in section 1  as a case study  we show how to exploit inference rules to improve the lower bound function of max-1-sat. section 1 shows experimental results. finally we conclude the paper in section 1.
1 a logical framework for weighted max-sat
in this section  we propose a logical framework for weighted max-sat  which is more general and suitable for studying the max-sat solving techniques than the one proposed in  larrosa and heras  1; heras and larrosa  1 .
1 basic notation and definitions
for convenience we introduce some notation and definitions. in propositional logic  a variable x may take values 1  for true  or 1  for false . a literal is either a variable or its negation. the variable related to literal l is denoted by var l . the negation of a variable  or literal  x is denoted by x¡¥. a clause c = l1 ¡Å l1 ¡Å ... ¡Å lm is a disjunction of literals in which no variable occurs more than once. a weighted clause is a pair  c w  where c is a clause and w is the weight of this clause. without loss of generality  we assume w is a natural number in this paper. a cnf formula is a conjunction of clauses. a weighted cnf formula is a set of weighted clause. a bounded formula is a pair  f k  where f is a weighted cnf formula and k  a natural number  is the upper bound of this formula. for a formula f over a variable set v   an assignment for f is a mapping fromand is denoted by a vector
  where n is the number of variables in v . the assignment is complete if; otherwise it is partial. an assignment satisfies a clause if it satisfies at least one literal in the clause. an assignment satisfies a cnf formula if it satisfies every clause in the formula. the instantiation of a formula f by forcing literal l to be true  denoted by f l   produces a new formula as follows: all clauses containing literal l are eliminated  and ¡¥l is deleted from each clause where it occurs. we use  to denote empty clause  which can not be satisfied by any assignment.
¡¡given a weighted cnf formula f and a complete assignment  we set
		w
does not satisfy c
which indicates the cost of.
¡¡given a weighted formula f  weighted max-sat problem is to find an assignment x such that is minimum. we denote such minimal value by opt f . since unweighted max-sat problem is a particular case in which w = 1 for every weighted clause  c w  in f  we only consider weighted max-sat problem in this paper.
1 the logical framework
definition 1 a complete assignment is called a model of a bounded formula  f k   if cost f x    k. a bounded formula is unsatisfiable if it has not any model.
¡¡obviously   f 1  is unsatisfiable for any weighted formula f and if   then  f k  is also unsatisfiable.
¡¡note that in the above definition  if k = 1  then a model should satisfy every clause in the formula  which is the same as the case in the context of sat problem. so sat solving can be considered as a special case in our logical framework.
¡¡according to definition 1  we can naturally generalize semantic entailment relation and equivalence relation from classical positional logic to our logical framework.
definition 1 given two bounded formulas  f1 k1  and
 f1 k1  
¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ f1 k1  |=  f1 k1  holds1 if every model of  f1 k1  is also a model of  f1 k1 .  f1 k1  and  f1 k1  are equivalent  denoted by  f1 k1  ¡Ô  f1 k1   if  f1 k1  |=  f1 k1  and  f1 k1  |=  f1 k1 .
definition 1 given two weighted cnf formulas f1 and f1 
f1 |= f1
holds  if  f1 k  |=  f1 k  for any k. two weighted cnf formulas f1 and f1 are equivalent  denoted by f1 ¡Ô f1  if f1 |= f1 and f1 |= f1.
¡¡the following proposition and corollary reveal the relation between our definitions and the weighted max-sat problem.
lemma 1 let f1 and f1 be weighted cnf formulas  f1 |=
f1  if and only if for every complete assignment and f1  we have

proposition 1 given two weighted cnf formulasf1 and f1  if f1 |= f1  then opt f1  ¡Ý opt f1 .
corollary 1 given two weighted cnf formulas f1 and f1  if f1 ¡Ô f1  then opt f1  = opt f1 .
¡¡now we describe the procedure max-dpll  which is slightly different from  larrosa and heras  1   for solving weighted max-sat as follows.
function max-dpll  f k :bounded formula :interger;
1. f:=applyequivalentrules  f k  ;
1. :=applynonequivalentrules  f k  ;
1.  then return k;
1. if f =   then return 1;
1. then return w;
1. l:=selectliteral f ;
1. v:=max-dpll  f l  k  ;
1. v:=max-dpll  f ¡¥l  v  ; 1. return v; end function
procedure 1: the procedure for solving weighted max-sat.
¡¡the max-dpll procedureis much like the dpll  and its correctness is derived from the recursive equation
opt f  = min{opt f l   opt f ¡¥l  }
the sub-procedures applyequivalentrules and applynonequivalentrules in lines 1 and 1 will be discussed later. for the moment  they can be considered as procedures just returning the input formula f. the initial value of variable k  upper bound of formula f  can be obtained by running a local search procedure  such as  borchers and furman  1 . now let's pay attention to inference rules for weighted max-sat. an inference rule is in this form:
p   q
where p and q are weighted cnf formulas. the procedure for applying an inference rule to a formula can be described as follows  wcf is short for weighted cnf formula :
function applyrule p   q:inference rule  f:wcf :wcf;
1. if p   f then f :=  f   p  ¡È q;
1. return f; end function
procedure 1: the procedure for applying an inference rule to a weighted cnf formula.
definition 1 an inference rule p   q is sound if for any weighted cnf formula r  we have opt p ¡È r  = opt q ¡È r .
¡¡an inference rule p   q is an equivalent rule if p ¡Ô q. the following proposition shows that applying equivalent rules to a formula can preserve its optimal value.
proposition 1 all equivalent rules are sound.
¡¡for a bounded formula  f k    larrosa and heras  1; heras and larrosa  1  incorporated the following inference rules into their weighted max-sat solvers:
  br1: { a k   a ¡Å b w }   { a k }   br1: { a w   a u }   { a w ¨’ u }
  br1: if w ¨’ u = k then { a w   a ¡Å b u }  
{ a w   a ¡Å b k }
  br1: { a 1 }   { }
  res: { x ¡Å a u   ¡¥x ¡Å b w }   { a ¡Å b m   x ¡Å

where x is any literal  a and b are arbitrary disjunction of literals  m = min{u w} in the res rule  and operators ¨’ and   are defined as

¡¡note that  larrosa and heras  1; heras and larrosa  1  incorporated some special cases of res rather than the general res rule.
¡¡by exploiting the above rules   heras and larrosa  1  implemented a weighted max-sat solver that outperforms other state-of-art solvers. however  we can observe that all the above rules are equivalent rules. it is no doubt that equivalent rules are sound  that is  preserve the model and the optimal value  so it is safe to exploit equivalent rules to produce a new formula. but if we only consider such rules  very few rules can be exploited.
¡¡an alternative way is to choose rules in this form p   q such that opt p  = opt q . unfortunately  applying such kind of rules is not safe  because opt p  = opt q  does not ensure the validity of opt p ¡Èr  = opt q¡Èr  where p  q  and r are weighted cnf formulas. a counter example is given as follows.
example 1 opt { x 1 }  = opt { x ¡Å y 1 }  = 1  but opt { x 1   ¡¥x 1 }  = 1 while opt { x ¡Å y 1   ¡¥x 1 }  = 1.
¡¡thus  if we attempt to incorporate more inference rules to weighted max-sat solvers  we should find rules that are not necessarily equivalent but can preserve the optimal value of the original formula. for this purpose  we introduce the following definition.
definition 1 let ¦« be a non-empty set of variables  two weighted cnf formulas f1 and f1 are said to be ¦«equivalent  denoted by f1 ¡Ö¦« f1  if for every weighted cnf formula p over ¦«  f1 |= p if and only if f1 |= p. an inference rule p   q is a ¦«-equivalent rule if p ¡Ö¦« q.
¡¡for ¦«-equivalent rules  we have the following proposition and theorem.
proposition 1 all equivalent rules are ¦«-equivalent for any ¦«.
theorem 1 if p   q is a ¦«-equivalent rule  and r is a weighted cnf formula over ¦«  then opt p ¡È r  = opt q ¡È r .
¡¡theorem 1 gives the condition under which we can apply ¦«-equivalent rules to the formula. and proposition 1 shows that ¦«-equivalent is a weaker notation than equivalent  that is  the set of equivalent rules is the subset of the set of ¦«equivalent rules. so  theoretically  considering ¦«-equivalent rules will provide more choices than considering equivalent rules only. thus  it is promising to employ ¦«-equivalent rules in weighted max-sat solvers. in section 1  we will propose several ¦«-equivalent rules.
¡¡now let us pay attention to nonequivalent rules which are neither equivalent nor ¦«-equivalent. we note that every inference rule p   q considered in this paper should satisfy p |= q. so although applying a nonequivalent rule to a formula may not preserve its optimal value  we may exploit it to compute a lower bound. from proposition 1  we can conclude that lower bounds that are computed in this way are admissible  namely the lower bound is always less than or equal to the optimal value. in fact  sometimes it is easier to use nonequivalent rules to obtain conflict clauses. for example   shen and zhang  1; li et al.  1  apply inference rules like. however  since such rules are not equivalent  they can not be used to achieve a tight lower bound usually. in section 1  we will discuss this problem.
1 some ¦«-equivalent inference rules
in this section we present two ¦«-equivalent rules and show in which situation they can be applied.
the first ¦«-equivalent rule we propose is
1-res: { x¡Åa u   ¡¥x¡Åb w }   { a¡Åb min{u w} }1where x is a literal  and a and b are arbitrary clauses  may be empty .
theorem 1 let ¦« be a non-empty set of variables. if var x  ¡Ê/ ¦«  then 1-res is a ¦«-equivalent rule.
proof without loss of generality  we may consider a and b as variables. it is easy to verify that { x ¡Å a u   ¡¥x ¡Å b w } |= { a ¡Å b min{u w} }  so for any weighted formula p  whenever { a¡Åb min{u w} } |= p  we also have { x¡Åa u   ¡¥x¡Åb w } |= p. now suppose { x¡Åa u   ¡¥x¡Å b w } |= p  where p is a weighted formula not containing x. there are four cases.
  case 1: a = 1 and b = 1  if x = 1  the cost is u  otherwise the cost is v  from lemma 1  the cost of p in this case should be less than min{u v}  which is not greater than the formula { a ¡Å b min{u w} } in this case.
  case 1: a = 1 and b = 1  if x = 1 the cost is u  otherwise is 1  from lemma 1  the cost of p should be 1  which is also not greater than { a¡Åb min{u w} }.
  case 1: a = 1 and b = 1  analysis is similar with above cases.
  case 1: a = 1 and b = 1  analysis is similar with above cases.
¡¡to sum up  we can conclude that no matter in which case  the cost of p is less than or equal to { a ¡Å b min{u w} } 
so we also have { a ¡Å b min{u w} } |= p.	
¡¡according to theorem 1 and theorem 1  if a formula f contains  x ¡Å a u  and  ¡¥x ¡Å b w   and var x  does not occur in other clauses in f  we can apply 1-res to f.
example 1 let f = { x ¡Å y 1   ¡¥x ¡Å z 1 }. if we apply the res rule  we will get { y¡Åz 1   ¡¥x¡Åz 1   x¡Åy¡Åz ¡¥ 1   ¡¥x¡Å y¡¥¡Åz 1 }  which is too complicated. but if we applythe 1-res rule  we will get a much simpler formula { y ¡Å z 1 }.
the second ¦«-equivalent rule we propose is
1-res: { x u   x ¡Å y v   ¡¥x ¡Å a w }  
       { y ¡Å a min{u ¨’ v w}   ¡¥y ¡Å a min{u w} } where x and y are literals  and a is the conjunction of arbitrary literals  may be empty .
¡¡note that we can apply the res rule to the right side of the 1-res rule to get simpler formula further.
theorem 1 let ¦« be a non-empty set of variables. if var x  ¡Ê/ ¦«  then 1-res is a ¦«-equivalent rule.
proof the proof is similar with theorem 1  so we omit it here.	
¡¡according to theorem 1 and theorem 1  if a formula f contains { x u    x¡Åy v   and  ¡¥x¡Åa w   and var x  does not occur in other clauses in f  we can apply 1-res to f.
example 1 let f = { x 1   x ¡Å y 1   ¡¥x ¡Å z 1   ¡¥z 1 }. the 1-res rule transforms f into { y ¡Å z 1   ¡¥y ¡Å z 1   ¡¥z 1 }. and the res rule transform the resulting formula into { z 1   ¡¥z 1 }  which can be simplified to.
1 a new lower bound function for max-1-sat
max-1-sat is a special case of weighted max-sat  in which each clause has weight 1 and at most two literals.  shen and zhang  1  studied several lower bound functions for max-1-sat  and proposed a lower bound function lower bound1a  which is proved to be admissible and consistently better than others. the procedure for calculating this function is as follows  lb1 is the number of conflicting  or empty  clauses by the current partial assignment .
function lower bound1a i:integer :integer;
1. lb1:=lb1;
1. while  i ¡Ü n  do
1. lb1:=lb1+min ¦Ì ¡¥i  ¦Ì i  ;
1. t := |¦Ì ¡¥i    ¦Ì i |;
1. if ¦Ì ¡¥i    ¦Ì i  then y := b i  else y := b ¡¥i ;
1. s := ¦Õ;
1. for j ¡Ê y if  t   1  do
1. if  ¦Ì j    ¦Ì ¡¥j   then s := s ¡È {j} else
1. t := t   1; ¦Ì j  := ¦Ì j  + 1;
1. end if
1. end for
1. for j ¡Ê s if  t   1  do
1. t := t   1; ¦Ì j  := ¦Ì j  + 1;
1. end for
1. i := i + 1;
1. end while 1. return lb1; end function
procedure 1: the procedure for computing lb1a.
¡¡the main idea of this procedure is to exploit the inference ruleto obtain a lower bound  due to limited space  for more details  please refer to the original paper . however  this rule is not equivalent  so the tight may be not tight enough. according to the res rule 
  so we exploit the rule to get a better lower bound. procedure 1 illustrates our algorithm. line 1 and 1 change the formula by deleting x ¡Å y and adding the clause x¡¥¡Åy¡¥. k can be considered as a constant number  in our code  we choose k = 1. so the time complexity of lower bound1 is the same as lower bound1a. in order to compare with lower bound1a  we write the pseudo code in the same style as procedure 1. note that the real code is far from this pseudo code.
function lower bound1 i  k:integer :integer;
1. lb1:=lb1;
1. i1 := i;
1. while  k   1  do
1. while  i ¡Ü n  do
1. lb1:=lb1+min ¦Ì ¡¥i  ¦Ì i  ;
1. t := |¦Ì ¡¥i    ¦Ì i |;
1. if ¦Ì ¡¥i    ¦Ì i  then y := b i  else y := b ¡¥i ;
1. s := ¦Õ;
1. for j ¡Ê y if  t   1  do
1. if  ¦Ì j    ¦Ì ¡¥j   then s := s ¡È {j} else
1. t := t   1; ¦Ì j  := ¦Ì j  + 1;
1. b i  := b i    {j}; b ¡¥i  := b ¡¥i  ¡È {¡¥j};
1. end if
1. end for
1. for j ¡Ê s if  t   1  do
1. t := t   1; ¦Ì j  := ¦Ì j  + 1;
1. b i  := b i    {j}; b ¡¥i  := b ¡¥i  ¡È {¡¥j};
1. end for
1. if ¦Ì ¡¥i    ¦Ì i  then ¦Ì ¡¥i  := t else ¦Ì i  := t;
1. i := i + 1;
1. end while
1. i := i1; k := k   1;
1. end while 1. return lb1; end function
procedure 1: the procedure for computing lb1.
¡¡the following theorem shows that lb1 is admissible and consistently better than lb1a.

1 experimental results
the experimental results are presented in this section. our solver  called ¦«-sat  is compared with the solver toolbar  http://carlit.toulouse.inra.fr/cgi-bin/awki.cgi/softcsp   which implemented by  larrosa and heras  1; heras and larrosa  1 . other solvers are not freely available and  heras and larrosa  1  showed that toolbar outperforms others. so we only compare our solver with toolbar.
¡¡our solver implements the variable selection strategy known as jeroslow-wang rule  jeroslow and wang  1   which is widely employed in state-of-art sat solvers. for inference rules  we choose the same as  heras and larrosa  1   additionally we also employ the new rules proposed in this paper. our tool is implemented in c.
¡¡we run two solvers with random max-1-sat  experimental results are illustrated in table 1  #varstands for the number of variables and #cls stands for the number of clauses  #node stands for the mean number of nodes of the whole search tree  time stands for the mean running time over 1 instances  and max-1-sat instances  experimental results are illustrated in table 1 . the instances are generated by the well-know generator cnfgen. executions are run on a 1 ghz pentium 1 computer with linux.

¡¡the results demonstrate that for small instances  the performance of the our solver is nearly the same as toolbar  while for large instances the former outperforms the latter  and especially for some larger instances  our solver can be orders of magnitude faster than toolbar.
1 conclusions and future work
the main contributions of this paper are in two aspects. first  we develop a general logical framework that is suitable for studying weighted max-sat problem. this is because many concepts in sat are easy to be extended in our framework. this may provide more chances to extend techniques taken by sat solvers to max-sat solvers. second  we propose several new inference rules  which can be exploited to get lower bound of better quality. the experimental results support our conclusion.
¡¡for future work  we will further study how to extend sat techniques to max-sat solver  such as clause learning and restarts. moreover  for unweighted max-sat  we notice that several lower bound computation techniques  li et al.  1   which focus on searching for disjoint inconsistent subformulas  have been proposed. based on our logical framework  we will attempt to generalize such techniques to compute lower bounds for weighted max-sat efficiently. recently  a simple model have been presented for generating random weighted max-1-sat instances  http://www.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/ kexu/benchmarks/max-satbenchmarks.htm . such instances are transformed from forced satisfiable sat instances of model rb  xu and li  1; xu et al.  1  and are  unfortunately  too hard for both toolbar and our solver. we will try to improve our solver to handle these benchmarks within reasonable time.
