 
proper names  whether english or non-english  have several different spellings when transliterated from a non-english source language into english. knowing the different variations can significantly improve the results of name-searches on various source texts  especially when recall is important. in this paper we propose two novel phonetic models to generate numerous candidate variant spellings of a name. our methods show threefold improvement over the baseline and generate four times as many good name variants compared to a human while maintaining a respectable precision of 1. 
1 	introduction 
in this paper  we present a novel approach for generating variant spellings of a person's name. 
 proper names in general are very important in text. since news stories especially revolve around people  places  or organizations  proper names play a major role in helping one distinguish between a general event  like a war  and a specific event  like the iraq war   raghavan and allan  1 . 
 proper names in english are spelled in various ways. despite the existence of one or more standard forms for someone's name  it is common to find variations in transliterations of that name in different source texts  such as osama vs usama. the problem is more pronounced when dealing with non-english names or when dealing with spellings by non-native speakers. 
 missing some spelling variations of a name may result in omission of some useful information in a search about a person. for example  imagine a defense analyst or reporter searching english transcripts of arabic tv news or newspaper articles for information about some person. transcribers or different news sources  may spell the name of the person differently and some relevant information about this person may never be found.  an automated spelling variant generator would help locate all potential mentions of the person in question.  
 another useful application for a variant spelling generator is transliteration. imagine a transliterator that uses a phoneme-based model to transliterate from a non-english source language to english  knight and graehl  1 . such a transliterator is quite likely to generate a spelling that is not the most commonly used spelling of a name. in such a case  we could use the spelling variant model to match up this spelling to its more commonly accepted variant s .  of course generating all the possible spelling variants of a name is a next to impossible task  given that this would require one to simulate all the possible corruptions that a sequence of characters could undergo to produce a reasonable spelling. but one could approximate this by using different models. 
 in this paper we propose two previously unexplored methods to generate the spelling variants of a person name. our first method is a unique phoneme-based approach using the cmu pronouncing dictionary1. here we first employ the em algorithm  baum  1; dempster et al.  1  to learn the mappings between letters and the corresponding phonemes in both directions. we then use a noisy channel model based translator to first generate n-best phoneme sequences for a name and then use a reverse translator to generate the n-best name variants for the phoneme sequences.  our second method is a completely unsupervised method in which we collect a list of over 1 million names  words  using a named entity extraction system applied to a large text corpus  about 1 gb plain text  collected from the web  and then use a popular sound based algorithm called soundex  knuth  1  to group together the variants in order to make them searchable. 
 as the baseline  we use a system based on the names list obtained from the us census1. this list consists of about 1 last names and 1 first names  male and female  collected by the us census bureau1. given a name  we use levenshtein distance or edit distance  hall and dowling  1  to find the names that are possible variants of a given name. 
 to the best of our knowledge  no one has ever used a bidirectional phoneme-based approach the way we have to generate spelling variants. raghavan and allan  have used soundex codes to normalize names in a corpus for the purpose of story link detection task and zobel and dart  have used soundex as one of the phonetic string matching algorithms for name retrieval.  
 the rest of the paper is organized as follows.  section 1 discusses some related work  section 1 describes our methods in detail  section 1 describes our experiments  section 1 presents the results and section 1 discusses our conclusion and future work. 
1 	related work 
the problem of spelling variants is a well studied problem in the information retrieval community  especially in the context of query expansion and word conflation. for this purpose  various methods including stemming and more complex morphological analysis have been proposed and widely used  hull  1; krovetz  1; tzoukermann et al.  1 .  these methods work very well with normal english words. however they cannot be effectively applied to proper names given the difference in the nature of proper names and other english words 
 in the past  people have worked with proper names. knight and graehl  proposed a cascaded finite state transducer  fst  based approach for name transliteration from japanese to english. virga and khudanpur  proposed a similar name transliteration approach for chinese to english to use in cross language information retrieval. both these approaches use sounds or pronunciations as their bridge to go from one language to the other. they however are targeted for transliteration between different languages  say japanese to english  and hence are not applicable for generating variants in the same language. raghavan and allan  studied the problem of proper name spelling variants in automatic speech recognition  asr . they proposed a number of methods to match inconsistently spelled names in asr. their methods however are tailored for speech recognition errors and require a parallel corpus of speech and the corresponding transcriptions. zobel and dart  used various phonetic string matching algorithms including soundex for name retrieval. their approach however deals only with matching phonetically similar names as against generating them. 
 none of these methods is suitable for our task since we want to be able to model reasonable transformations a name spelling could undergo to actually generate variant spellings for a name. 
1 generating spelling variants 
in this section  we present two distinct and complementary approaches to generating the different spellings of a name. in the first method  we use a supervised learning approach to overgenerate a large number of variant spellings by variations in pronunciation. we call this the pronunciation learning method. 
 in the second method we use a novel approach to first obtain a large list of names  group the similar sounding names using soundex  knuth  1   and then use soundex to find the different spellings for a name. we call this the list soundex method. 
1. 1 pronunciation learning method 
in this method  we use the cmu pronouncing dictionary1  a pronunciation dictionary for north american english  as the data for training our models. the cmu dictionary consists of over 1 english words along with their pronunciations in a fixed set of 1 phonemes. 
1.1	noisy channel model 
we use the noisy channel model  which is commonly used in machine translation and speech recognition  as our basic model. in this framework for machine translation  the target language sentence e has supposedly been corrupted into the source language sentence f due to a noisy channel  brown et al.  1 . 
 	argmax p e | f  = argmax p e *p f | e   	 	 	 	 1  
     e  	 	 	 	 	 	 	e where -  
 p e : represents the probability of the target language sentence e  language model   
 p f | e : represents the probability of generating the source language sentence f given the target language sentence e  translation model  
 p e | f : represents the probability of generating the target language sentence e given the source language sentence f  estimated using the noisy channel model 
 similarly  in our case we assume a variant spelling of a name to be the result of a two translation processes:  
1. the characters in the original name are translated into n-best sequences of phonemes 
1. phoneme sequences are translated back into n-best character sequences  thus generating the variants. we therefore have two noisy channels  one representing the translation from a character sequence  c  to a phoneme sequence  ph   text to speech  and other representing the translation form a phoneme sequence back to a character sequence  speech to text .
text to speech: 
 	argmax p ph | c  = argmax p ph *p c | ph   	 	 1  
    	ph  	 	    	 	 	ph 
speech to text: 
 	argmax p c | ph  = argmax p c *p ph | c   	 	 1        c  	 	    	 	 	 	c 
1.1	training 
we apply the em algorithm  baum  1; dempster et al.  1  in two directions to the cmu dictionary to obtain the ibm model-1  brown et al  1  alignments between the characters and phonemes in both the directions. this gives us the two translation models - p ph | c  and p c | ph . 
 to obtain the phoneme language model p ph  we use the 1+ phoneme sequences from the cmu dictionary. using this as training data  we build a phoneme trigram language model. 
 to obtain the character language model p c   we use the list of 1 million names that we extracted from text. using this as training data  we build a character trigram language model. 
1.1	implementation 
we use the giza++ package  och and ney  1  to train our translation models. we obtain the alignments between letters and phonemes in both the directions using giza++ and then based on the alignments  we build translation models for both  text to speech  and  speech to text .
 we use the cmu-cambridge statistical language modeling toolkit1 to build the language models. we use trigram based language models for both the letters and phonemes.   following knight and graehl   we represent each of our language models as a weighted finite state automaton  wfsa  and each of our translation models as a weighted finite state transducer  wfst . we then use the usc/isi finite state transducer toolkit carmel1 to perform the composition between the corresponding wfst and wfsa to obtain two noisy channel based wfst decoders - one going from letters to phonemes  text to speech  and the other going from phonemes to letters  speech to text . 
 to obtain variant spellings for a given name  we place the two noisy channel based wfst decoders in a cascade. the first generates an n-best list of pronunciations for a given input name. the second then produces an n-best list of spellings for each of the pronunciations. we then combine the nbest spellings generated by each of the pronunciations and rank the combined output by sorting it based on  a  increasing order of edit distance from the original name   b  decreasing order of the weight a name variant gets from the decoder and  c  decreasing order of the number of times a variant is generated by the different pronunciations. ties  if any  are broken randomly. 
1 list soundex method 
in this method  we use a huge database of names combined with a phonetic sound matching algorithm called soundex to find variant spellings. 
1.1	creating a list of names 
the web contains many proper names. one could search and create databases of names by manually collecting various name lists like the lists for baby names  census lists etc.   we have found that trying to create name lists manually is not only a tedious task but also results in very sparsely populated lists. even the best resource of names that we know of  the us census name list  contains fewer than 1 names  and those are us names only. apart from this  hand-created lists that are meticulously prepared by experts are mostly well spelled names. we are interested in finding the common misspellings of names. 
 to overcome these limitations we decided to create a list of names automatically. using a corpus containing about 1gb of english text gathered from the web in a previous project  ravichandran et al.  1   we applied the bbn identifinder  a state of the art named-entity extraction system  bikel et al.  1   to it. we extracted all the entities that the named-entity extractor tagged as  person names . this gave us a list of about 1 million unique names. 
1.1	soundex algorithm 
levenshtein distance or edit distance  hall and dowling  1  is a measure of similarity between two strings  measuring the number of insertions  deletions  and substitutions required to transform a string into the other.  
 traditionally  edit distance has been used for spelling error detection and correction  kukich  1 . we can use the same edit distance as a measure for finding names that are close to a given name by doing a lookup in a name list. but calculating edit distance between two strings is o n1  in the length of the strings. it is impossible in practice to use this measure when comparing against a large list. we need to do better. we should at least initially prune our candidates down and then use edit distance on this pruned list of candidates. 
 the soundex algorithm  knuth  1   first patented in 1 by margaret o'dell and robert c. russel  is an approximate string matching algorithm. it produces a coarsegrained representation for a string using six phonetic classes of human speech sounds  bilabial  labiodental  dental  alveolar  velar  and glottal . the representation consists of the first letter of the word followed by three digits that together represent the phonetic class of that word. 
 we use soundex to divide our huge list of names into bins of similar sounding names and then index our list on the soundex four-character code. now  whenever we get a name whose variants have to be found  we can look only at the appropriate soundex-bin instead of the whole list  thus making the search for variants possible in practice. 
1.1	implementation 
we use the named-entity extraction system bbn identifinder to identify named entities in our corpus. we then collect all the  person  names from the tagged corpus and find all the unique names along with their corpus frequencies. then we run soundex on the list of names and divide then into bins of similar sounding names. we obtain about 1 bins  with on average 1 names in each bin. 
 to obtain the variants of a name  we first find the soundex code for that name. then in the corresponding soundexbin  we find the n-best variants by sorting them based on  a  increasing order of edit distance from the original name and  b  decreasing order of frequency in the corpus. ties  if any  are broken randomly. 
1 	experiments 
1 experimental setup 
it is not immediately clear how one can evaluate a name spelling generator.  we therefore perform experiments to measure the performance of the different methods on the spelling variants generation task.

1 baseline 
the us census list  one of the largest publicly available list of us names  contains about 1 last names and about 1 first names  male and female . apart from the names itself  the list provides information about the frequency of each name. we use this list as the resource for building our baseline system. 
 for each of the 1 test names  we obtain variants by finding the top 1 names that are closest in levenshtein edit distance to the given name and sort them based on  a  increasing order of edit distance   b  decreasing order of frequency. 
1. results 
1 evaluation metrics 
we use the standard natural language processing measures of precision  recall  and f-score to measure the performance of each of the systems. 
 to obtain precision  we ask a human to look at all the outputs generated by each of the systems and mark then as correct or incorrect variants. then the precision  p  for each system can be obtained as- 
   	p = # of correct systemoutputs       1 
# of systemoutputs
 given that we do not have a comprehensive gold standard list of variants of a name  finding true recall is quite hard. but we can obtain recall of each system relative to a human. to do this  we ask a human to look at each of the 1 test names and generate a set of possible variants for each name. we then compare the output of each system to that of the human generated list. then the recall  r  for each system can be obtained as- 
  r= #of systemoutputsin thehuman list   	 	 1  

# of outputsin thehuman list
the f-score  f  is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. it is calculated as- 
	1*p*r   	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 1  
f=
p + r
1 result scores and graphs 
table 1 shows the comparison of precision  recall  and fscores of the pronunciation generation  list soundex  and baseline systems for different numbers of outputs. the outputs are varied from top 1 to top 1 and their effect on the macro-averaged precision  macro-averaged recall  and macro-averaged f-score is shown.

figure 1: f-score graph 
¡¡ figures 1  1 and 1 graph the precision  recall  and fscores respectively of the three systems corresponding to the number of outputs of the system varying from top 1 to top 1. 
 we find that for the top 1 name variants  the performances of the pronunciation learning and the list soundex methods are very close to each other. the pronunciation learning method has an f-score of 1 while the list soundex method has an f-score of 1. both the systems show roughly three-fold improvement over the baseline  which has an f-score of 1. the result is validated by the twotailed paired student's t-test  manning and sch¨¹tze  1 . the t-test shows a statistically significant difference at p 1 between the baseline and both the systems. however  it shows no statistically significant difference between the performances of the pronunciation learning and list soundex systems themselves. 
 the graphs for the three systems show an intuitive trend. we find that as we increase the number of outputs that each system generates from 1 to 1  the precision of each system goes down slowly while the recall goes up. 
1 discussion 
it is clear from the results above that the pronunciation based methods for generating name variants reap good results. further it is clear that by using these methods  significant improvement over the baseline can be achieved.
 what is also encouraging is the relative recall compared to humans. we find that for the 1 test names  a human was able to generate on an average four variant spellings. however both the pronunciation generation and list soundex methods generated 1 variants with a precision of 1  i.e.  about 1 correct variants  which is four times what a human could generate.  this of course goes in line with the general observation that humans are good at telling a good thing from a bad but are not so good at generating a set of possible good things. 
 what is also interesting is that the precision  recall  and fscores of the pronunciation generation and list soundex methods are significantly better than the baseline at all the output sizes. this came as a bit of a surprise initially  because we expected the baseline to perform well at least when the number of outputs is small  given that the baseline system uses a large meticulously prepared list of names  us census list . we however feel now that the very fact that the us census list was meticulously prepared went against the baseline given the nature of the task  where it is as important to have misspellings as to have correct spellings. 
1. conclusion 
the results here clearly show the success of using the phonetic models for the purpose of generating spelling variants. we attribute this success to the fact that spelling variants more often than not have to do with the ambiguous mapping between pronunciations and their corresponding rendering into letter sequences  spellings . our models derive their power from the very fact that different people on one hand tend to pronounce the same letter sequences differently and on the other tend to write different spellings for the same pronunciation. 
 one other striking observation is the four-fold increase in the number of good name variations compared to the variants generated by a human. this clearly reinforces the need of a variant generator for the name query expansion task.  another interesting conclusion is the clear superiority of the automatic acquisition of large name lists compared to the slow manual preparation for the purpose of generating variants even in the low recall ranges  top 1 outputs   as is demonstrated by the high performance of the list soundex method compared to the baseline. 
 in the future  we would like to build a hybrid system that can combine the outputs of both the algorithms and rank the combined output in a meaningful way. we would also like to test our algorithms with non-english names. our initial experiments with non-english names look very promising though we presently do not have a baseline to compare against for these names. we would further like to apply our algorithms to other entities  such as technical terms  that are likely to be misspelled for the same reason as person names. also  in the future we plan to modify the algorithms to tailor the variants for the kind of mistakes that are more likely to occur while spelling names from different languages and by native speakers of different languages owing to the different sounds present in those languages.
