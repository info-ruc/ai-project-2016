1. the appropriateness and feasibility of intelligent aids for practicing litigators and other legal experts; 1. implications for other domains - like medicine that use case-based reasoning; 
1. methodological and other issues. 
for each issue considered  the comments of the panelists are summarized. 
1. the challenge and special characteristics of the legal domain 
     the legal domain presents some very interesting challenges to the ai researcher. while it is a domain which has established standards for deriving new truths  e.g.  stare decisis or the doctrine of precedent   it is more of a  scruffy  domain than a  neat  one  despite its orderly  rule-like surface veneer. it is very much an experience-based example-driven field. legal reasoning is also heavily intertwined with natural language processing and common sense reasoning and therefore inherits all the hard problems that these imply. 
     several panelists emphasize that legal reasoning and argumentation take special skills and that learning to think like a lawyer requires considerably more than rote memorization of a large number of cases  a daunting task in itself. for instance  dyer says: 
modeling what a lawyer does is more complex than modeling experts in technical/scientific domains. first  all of these complex conceptualizations are expressed in natural language  so modeling the comprehension ability of the lawyer requires solving the natural language problem. for example  giving legal advice often starts with hearing a  story  where the client was one of the actors. so legal advice often presupposes a story understanding capability. in other expert systems  the natural language problem can be largely finessed since the task  e.g.  disease diagnosis  reconfiguring hardware  analyzing dipmeters  rarely involves the communication of complex conceptualizations. second  the planning in this domain is complex. this is a world where actors obtain agents  where they counterplan  retaliate  attempt to set up subsumption states  etc. third  anglo-american jurisprudence  at least  makes use of a large body of concrete episodes. becoming a lawyer requires learning how to index  generalize and apply these concrete episodes in service of reasoning and argumentation strategies. fourth  law is simply an attempt to formalize common sense reasoning and notions of justice  morality and fair play. 
     rissland points out the analogies between legal and mathematical reasoning. in her analysis  learning to be an expert mathematician or mathematics student involves a lot more than simply learning definitions  theorems and proofs. there is a wealth of other knowledge and skills needed: for instance  there is a large corpus of examples and heuristics  and there is the important skill of being able to generate examples  rissland  1 . similar remarks can be made about the legal domain  levi  1; llewellyn  1 . in particular  cases in law play the analogous role to examples in other fields. however  in addition to the usual questions about examples - such as their function and generation the law is a domain which is largely case or example-based and thus examples are truly central. 

     the law also exhibits many of the traits discussed by kuhn with regard to scientific disciplines  kuhn  1 . in particular  the dialectic between proposing an idea or rule and the testing of it through concrete cases - so well discussed by lakatot  and polya  - can also be found in the law and other fields  rissland  1c . 
     waterman notes several special characteristics of the law: 
the law combines many different kinds of reasoning processes: rule-based  case-based  analogical  hypothetical. 
it has the unique property of being pseudo-formalized  i.e.  there exists a large body of formal rules that purport to define and regulate activity in the domain. however  these rules are often deliberately ambiguous  contradictory and incomplete. many of the actual rules used in legal reasoning are rules about how to access and reason with the  formal** rules. the problem this creates is the naive notion  for some  that because a body of rules and regulations exists  all one has to do is translate them into executable code to create a legal reasoning program. 
the law is in a constant state of change  so expert legal reasoning systems have to be easy to modify and update. many other application domains have this characteristic  but perhaps not to quite the same extent. 
     gardner not only joins others in pointing out the challenge for ai presented by the intertwining of natural language and common sense knowledge in legal reasoning but also she remarks on some differences concerning the nature of expertise in the law compared with other domains of expert systems work: 
law is an area for  expert systems  in the sense of involving professional knowledge  but it is unusual in that we have to expect the experts to disagree.  e.g.  opposing counsel; judges writing majority and dissenting opinions.  questions then arising are:  1  what kinds of things can they disagree on  and what kinds of disagreement are beyond the bounds of professional competence   1  how can a reasoning system leave room for the appropriate kinds of disagreement  
e. rissland 1 
what this language means. this aspect of law calls for a different approach to meaning from that taken in most ai programs.  see discussion of open texture below.   1  the situations to which we might want to apply legal knowledge encompass practically the whole range of human activity - with a special focus on those human situations where something goes wrong. thus a truly expert system would be able to represent and reason about such situations using a great deal of commonsense knowledge as well as techincal knowledge. this last is true of some other kinds of expert systems too. 
1. the open-textured nature of legal concepts 
     unlike certain other domains like mathematics or even medicine  concepts in the law tend to be 
 open-textured**  that is  one cannot provide black and white definitions. interpreting a legal concept in a new situation depends on past interpretations. to decide whether a legal predicate applies to a fact situation  one must usually find cases in which the predicate was applied and focus on similarities or dissimilarities. 
     gardner  who addressed this issue in considerable detail in her recent doctoral thesis  gardner  1  especially sections 1-1   summarizes: 
legal language is open-textured in that  1  we cannot state necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of legal predicates and  1  neither can we take legal predicates as primitives in the sense that a program could simply recognize whether or not the predicate applies to some fact situation.  that is  a legal rule  px implies qx  and a fact pa do not entail legal consequence qa.  
     this characterization of open texture covers several phenomena. one is the variable standard  eg.   a reasonable time** . another is vagueness  although legal rules do tend to avoid using obviously vague words legislators write rules about people over 1  not about  old** people . the most important  however  is that legal conclusions that appear to follow deductively are in fact defeasible. that im  given the legal rule  px implies qx  and the fact pa  the conclusion qa is only a default conclusion. 

law is also an area deeply involving natural language and commonsense understanding. in particular:  1  legal materials  such as statutes and other statements of legal rules  are written in natural language  and the problem of saying how they apply to a particular situation is in large part a problem of saying ashley points out that the law's handling of open-textured predicates is not neutral  that is  the decision about the concept is tied in with who the decider wants to win the case: 
in deciding whether a legal predicate applies to a fact situation  a court usually also 

1 e. rissland 
determines who should win the issue or the case. the criteria for deciding whether the predicate applies are rarely completely specifiable in rules. the court must usually find cases in which the predicate was applied and focus on similarities or dissimilarities between the new fact situation and past cases. it must decide if the comparison cuts in favor of following the prior case or distinguishing it. this analysis is significantly different from trying to apply some abstract definition of the legal predicate. any attempt to model legal reasoning must take account of this aspect of case-based reasoning. 
1. the complementarity of case-based and rule-based reasoning 
     one way cases are used is to give concrete content to the concepts and abstractions in legal rules. even if one believes that the law can be captured in rules - which many  particularly the legal realists  do not - one needs cases to flesh out the meaning and intent of the rules. as gardner has put it  cases are what you use  when the rules run our. most scholars of the common law  would say that cases are what you use all the time - even if you have rules and know how to apply them. mccarty has long campaigned the importance of this point for ai work on legal reasoning; for instance see  mccarty  1; mccarty and sridharan  1a . 
     rissland restated the theme of the intertwining of case-based and rule-based reasoning  and that it is akin to the proofs-and-refutations dialectic between concept/conjecture and examples talked about by lakatos. in fact  she suggests  as has gardner  that one could carry this computationally further for handling the different types of questions discussed by gardner  gardner  1 : a rule-based approach for the  easy  or black-and-white questions and a case-based approach for the  hard** or gray-area questions. a rule-based reasoner should be able to call on the services of a case-based reasoner when the predicates get murky or the rules run out and a case-based reasoner should be able to call a rule-based reasoner for the well-understood  well-structured aspects of its problems. 
1. the pervasive role of analogy 
     ashley identifies several uses of analogy in legal argumentation and practice  ashley  1  including: 
1. precedents that are analogous in some sense to the case being decided are used to focus the attention of the advocate on those issues and authorities which have a bearing upon the argument; 
1. the precedent provides an example of what a reasonable argument in an analogous context looks like; 
1. an existing classification from a precedent may be applied to analogous facts in the case being decided; 
1. a new classification  analogous to a classification in a precedent  may be created and applied to the facts in the case being decided. 
     gardner points out that if one takes analogy to refer to comparing facts of cases for the purpose of arguing that a new case should be decided in the same way as an old  similar case  then the crux of the issue is what makes some factual similarities and differences important and others irrelevant; this involves more than a simple comparison of facts. 
     mccarty has addressed this issue in his taxman ii research  especially concerning the famous tax case of eisner 
v. macomber. if one can imagine a sequence of intermediate hypotheticals connecting the two cases to be analogized then the sequence of intermediate transformations provide a key to the analogy. for a detailed analysis  see  mccarty and sridharan  1b . 
     dyer echoes some of mccarty'% and rissland s concerns  particularly on the utility of the idea of deformations and standard or prototype cases  with an added emphasis on the key role of memory in analogy: 
functioning successfully as a lawyer requires having indexed key cases in such a way that the comprehension of novel cases leads immediately to access of key cases. in a sense  legal reasoning and comprehension involves finding  islands** of legal prototypes from which well-known reasoning paths can be adapted to the novel situations and then traversed. much of legal reasoning  therefore  is a memory indexing and search problem rather than a logical or  theorem-proving** problem. 
1. the role of hypotheticals 
     hypotheticals - that is  make-believe cases - serve many roles in legal reasoning. several of the panelists  in particular  mccarty  rissland  and ashley  agreed on their importance. all three make strong use of hypotheticals in their models of legal reasoning and generate them in a somewhat similar framework  called  prototype plus deformation** by mccarty and  modification plus retrieval** by rissland  who also taxonomizes examples into classes like  model   standard reference  anomaly  etc. . 
     rissland enumerates some of the uses that hypos play in legal reasoning and argumentation  rissland  1a  bj. 
for instance  some general functions of hypos are: 
1. hypos remake experience 
1. hypos create experience 
1. hypos organize and cluster cases 
1. hypos tease out hidden assumptions 
for instance  the second usage allows one to consider issues that have not yet been litigated  and may well be   e.g.  the recent case of the frozen embryo which was predeceased by its parents or a malpractice suit against an expert system . thus hypos can contribute to strategic planning by providing what-if situations - especially contrary ones - to consider. this can lead to a debugging an argument or strategy ahead of time. 
     ashley elaborates on three roles played by hypothetical! in the context of argumentation: 
     1. in a legal argument  a hypothetical can be used to isolate the weaknesses and strengths of an attorney's case. a hypo can be constructed to emphasize one aspect of a case that pushes strongly for a decision contrary to the proponent's  perhaps by making it more like a line of contrary cases or by exaggerating some common sense objection to following the proponent's classification. one way for the proponent to respond is to distinguish the hypo and his case. in so doing  the proponent is forced to emphasize the other strengths of his case that are not present in the hypo. 
     1. a hypothetical can be used to illuminate the consequences of a decision. a court may ask   if we decide in favor of the proponent on this case  what will we do when a case with somewhat less sympathetic facts is posed *' it is an exercise in line drawing. if no defensible lines can be drawn  the court may choose not to decide in favor of the proponent  or at least not on the grounds argued for. 
     1. in both of the above  the hypothetical is used as a short hand for lines of cases  lines of reasoning  even whole arguments. 
     such uses of hypotheticals in legal argument can be illustrated by excerpts from oral arguments before the united states supreme court in which the justices pose hypotheticals to make and elicit legal points and to control the presentation of a proponent's case  e.g.  the questioning by the justices in the recent civil rights case of gomez-bethke v. us. jaycees  1   and to justify and explain their conclusions  e.g.  see the opinion of justice pitney and the dissent of justice brandeis in the landmark corporate tax case of eisner v. macomber  1  . 
1. interleaving of justification  explanation and argumentation 
     waterman reminds us that explanation  explaining how you reached a conclusion  and justification  providing a convincing argument that the method used to reach the conclusion is valid  aren't as easy in law as they are in 
e. rissland 1 
some other domains which have clear underlying  deep  models of the mechanisms involved  mechanisms that can provide predictive and explicative power. he is joined by mccarty in this concern. 
     waterman asks us to consider the question   what are the fundamental models in the legal domain and what constitutes a real  justification'* of an answer ** 
     of course  the legal community in its answer would surely mention the doctrine of precedent and the use of cases as fundamentals in justification and argumentation. the ai community would emphasize representation and models of process. ashley  mccarty and rissland all cite the important role of hypotheticals in justification and argumentation. ashley and rissland go further to also say that cases and hypotheticals can carry a large part of the burden of explanation as well. thus waterman's question can be re-posed to ask for the details of haw cases are used in justification  argumentation  and explanation. 
     dyer points out that this interleaving has methodological consequences: process models of legal expertise must be designed as a whole  where beliefs  goals  planning  and arguing are integrated. 
1. the law as a learning system 
     on this issue there is some disagreement. rissland can view the law  with all its cases  rules  statutes  etc  as a learning system in that the law responds to its environment which presents it cases to be dealt with and in response changes its case base  rules  statutes  etc.  as well as its ways of dealing with its environment. this view is elaborated somewhat by ashley: 
experience in the legal system is accumulated in two places: in its database of cases and in the implicit rules that develop for comparing fact situations in a particular domain. these rules are learned by law students in learning to  think like lawyers.** they are evidenced by the choices that courts make in applying precedents but they are not authoritatively set forth in any restatement  statute or case. the rules make it possible to apply the precedents to new cases. they are how the law learns. 
     mccarty sees the law as a  theory construction  system that is constructing new concepts. 
dyer feels strongly that it is the lawyers who learn: 
the law is not a learning system; lawyers 
are. lawyers index legal episodes in episodic memory. as new situations arise  new judgements are made and episodes are reorganized in memory. this is just how the law student learns: by being presented with a case  applying whatever legal and common 1 e. rissland 
tente intuitiont are currently available  indexing the cate along recognized abttract legal issues  and then modifying and reindexing as new cases  with alternate outcomes and opinions  are encountered. 
1. intelligent aids for practicing litigators 
     the panel as a whole voiced somewhat cautious optimism that it would eventually be possible to develop a lawyer's workbench which would include tools ranging from standard retrieval tools like the existing westlaw and lexis full text retrieval systems  document generation aids  scheduling and calendar managers  to tools needing more intelligence like briefing assistants and interpretive analysis programs which could understand cases. this caution is based upon the nearly common experience of how long it takes to develop a program that can handle a few cases or problems  let alone the plethora occurring in real practice. 
     mccarty sees two main categories of intelligent applications programs: conceptual legal retrieval systems and legal analysis and planning systems. he elaborates: 
 ...the most critical task in the development of an intelligent legal information system  either for document retrieval or for expert advice  is the construction of a conceptual model of the relevant legal domain. 
 ...these models will not be easy to formulate and the corresponding information systems will not be easy to construct. for the near term  then  the critical problem will be to select an appropriate level of conceptual detail  and an appropriate level of system complexity.**  mccarty  1a  p. 1 . 
1. implications and relevance for other case-baaed domains 
     most of the panelists did not express much enthusiasm for useful cross-fertilization between law and other domains  like medicine  except for rissland who believes that there is something shared in that both domains use cases - albeit in different ways - especially in areas where the diseases are new or not well understood  i.e.  where there might not be rules . all feel that the details of such cross-discipline enlightment are vague at this point. 
dyer puts it: 
i believe that modeling lawyers is a much more complex task than modeling doctors. this is mainly because the expert systems approach has restricted itself to those areas where immediate success is possible. if we admit that medicine is not simply rule-based diagnosis over symptoms with weighted and propagated certainty factors  then we open up the harder issues in medicine. these issues 
are those shared with law: namely  how do doctors  lawyers  read and understand medical  legal  texts  what must doctors  lawyers  know about the physiological  socio-cultural  processes of the body  everyday affairs  in order to be able to understand  plan and give advice  
     such concerns are also shared by mccarty who points out that the shallow reasoning exhibited by certain medical diagnosis programs  like mycin  is not at all like  or sufficient for  the deep reasoning  for instance  with respect to its representation and causal models  required in the legal domain. mccarty recaps some of his recent comments from  mccarty  1a  where he asked  if shallow rule-based systems have been so successful in the medical field  why do i insist that they have such serious limitations in the legal field ** mccarty's answer to this paradox lies in the differences of the nature of the rules involved. in medicine  the rules are empirical  associative  probablistic rules of thumb  which are used cumulatively and which do not reflect any deep causal models  say of bacterial disease. whereas in medicine  this might be enough to get the job done  in the law it is not except for certain discretionary legal issues like  reasonable care**. interestingly  rule-based treatment of discretionary judgements  e.g.  the worthwhileness of a civil suit  has already met with some success  waterman and peterson  1 . 
1. methodological and other 
     there is the usual two way relationship between ai and the law. the law is a field which might be able to profitably use ai concepts and technology to further its own aims such as developing jurisprudential analyses of legal reasoning or developing intelligent litigation aids and the law provides an excellent task domain for ai research. 
     dyer addresses whether these two approaches entail different standards and whether this matters: 
for a person not interested in modeling intelligence  but in supplying the lawyer with smart legal aids  the approach may be different. i believe that this particular subdiscipline for ai is too young to decide that one  or the other  approach should not be tried  but i believe that more is to be gained ultimately by modeling the mind in the domain of law than modeling law using currently known insights about intelligence  artifical or otherwise . 
     gardner feels that it might be a difference more of degree than kind: 
e. rissland 1 
applicable in law. the results here may look 	bibliography at one end  there are people trying to build systems useful to lawyers  or trying to find out how far present ai techniques are like lots of law and not much that's new for ai. 
at the other end  for the purpose of studying some ai problem  you could create a microworld and call it law. the results might have as little to do with a lawyer's view of law as winston's  shakespeare world** has to do with an english professor's view of shakespeare. 
but the reason i said the distinction was a 
matter of degree was that  to some extent  we can't help working with microworlds. that is  every study of law or legal reasoning  ai or otherwise  has to work with an abstracted version of its domain. it's most important to try to be clear about what simplifications one is making  and to consider from what point of view these simplifications are reasonable. 
     several panelists feel that progress in the area of ai and law requires further progress in fundamental ai and cognitive science research on issues like representation. this is a point emphasized increasingly by mccarty: 
successful work in law and ai - both theory and application - requires much better  conceptual models'* of the legal domain than the field of ai can currently provide 
 off-the-shelf*. 
part of mccarty's response to this problem is his work on  permissions and obligations** which addresses the fundamental  hohfeldian** mechanisms of lights  privileges  duties  etc. underlying our legal system. other work  like that of debessonet  on legal representation primitives  also contributes to this basic research. 
     other issues of concern to the panel included sociological issues  for instance  the impact of intelligent or  semi- automated legal services and how this will effect society's relationship with the legal system  e.g.  will legal services become accessible to more people  will people become more  do it yourself** . what will be the nature of the symbiosis between man and machine in the legal domain. of course  there was also the issue of the law applied to ai programs  for instance  potential tort  or even criminal  actions involving ai programs  e.g.  a medical malpractice suit against a medical expert system . many of these issues are addressed in the panel on  ai and social responsibility**  chaired by maggie boden  and reported on in these proceedings.
