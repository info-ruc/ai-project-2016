the advent of t h e nasa space s h u t t l e is opening a new era in space. a era where ready l o w - c o s t access to space makes p o s s i b l e l a r g e s p a c e - s t r u c t u r e s   and the b e g i n n i n g o f space i n d u s t r i a l i z a t i o n   i n c r e a s e d g l o b a l i n f o r m a t i o n s e r v i c e s   and enhanced s c i e n t i f i c e x p l o r a t i o n o f the u n i v e r s e .

i n c r e a s i n g the l e v e l of autonomy of space o p e r a t i o n s appears to be one approach to y i e l d i n g l a r g e cost r e d u c t i o n s . the j e t p r o p u l s i o n l a b o r a t o r y estimates t h a t a p p r o x i m a t e l y one t h i r d of the cost of missions i s a s s o c i a t e d w i t h ground support o p e r a t i o n s . thus  r e d u c t i o n s i n m i s s i o n o p e r a t i o n system development and o p e r a t i o n s costs can p l a y a major r o l e in reducing costs of space m i s s i o n s .

potential benefits associated with increasing 
autonomous operations 

figure 1 
o r b i t a l operations  and remote operations of systems in hostile environments. 
at the present time humans exercise direct control over nearly a l l decisions required by spacecraft or space experiments as well as those decisions associated with data handling and data processing. to do t h i s requires extensive communications  ground support equipment  computer f a c i l i t i e s   data processing equipment  and support personnel. a l l these items become expensive for extended missions or for extensive data collection and processing. in addition  due to communication time lags and the time needed to process information and v e r i f y decisions on the ground  the benefits which can be derived from real time operations at the spacecraft are often l o s t . 
we are now entering the era  due to advances in computers  sensors and robotic algorithms where the increasing substitut i o n of autonomous operations can y i e l d large cost savings and increased mission return benefits. 
the goal is to contribute toward a factor of ten reduction in ground-support costs  substantially reduce spacecraft system costs  and increase mission information return by a factor of 1. increasing spacecraft autonomy by automating onboard mission planning and modification w i l l help contribute to this goal. examples of applications are: self-checkout  test and repair; onboard data evaluation; semiautonomous spacecraft experiment control; supervisory teleoperator and semi-autonomous rover systems for planetary exploration and sample c o l l e c t i o n   evaluation and return. 
research in robotics/machine intelligence is performed p r i n c i p a l l y at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory with assistance from industry and universities supported by a hq grant program. the program has two major facets. theoretical studies are being conducted in university and indust r i a l laboratories to complement those at jpl and to expand the machine approximation of human cognitive processes. at jpl  a robot demonstration program  figure 1  

figure 1  integraged robot test facility 
is being pursued to provide practical tests and evaluations of machine intelligence concepts  define research requirements and develop and demonstrate system applications. jpl is also currently focusing on  1  determining space program operations that can substantially benefit from the application of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence technology  1  determining the appropriate application of this technology to these operations and  1  working with potential users to demonstrate the f e a s i b i l i t y of these techniques to the level where they can be considered for future missions. 
under technical monitorship from jpl engineers  nasa headquarters sponsors several research grants and contracts with major centers of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence research. currently  emphasis is centered on the development of programming theory for automated problem solving at the university of maryland that makes more effective use of computer capacity; the use of scene analysis techniques at the stanford research i n s t i t u t e to automate a class of tasks involving the continuous monitoring or tracking of predefined targets; research i n a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i gence at m.i.t. aimed at providing a better understanding of the computational aspects of cognitive process  and in designing machines that w i l l automate such processes; research and hard-

invited panei-1: gevarter 1 the i n t e l l i g e n t systems program i s b r i e f l y d e s c r i b e d a s f o l l o w s : 
 this program is directed toward r e search on computer-based systems 
which have some of the characterist i c s of i n t e l l i g e n c e . relevant areas include pattern recognition  pattern generation  knowledge representation  problem s o l v i n g   natural language understanding  theorem proving  and others which r e l a t e to the automatic analysis and handling of complex tasks.  
it is one of six programs supporting basic research in computer science  the others being theoretical computer science  software systems science  software engineering  computer systems design  and special proj e c t s . some representative grants from t h i s program are: 
1. molgen: a computer science applicat i o n to molecular genetics 
the general goal of t h i s research is to develop a computer system  molgen  to assist a molecular g e n e t i c i s t in planning laboratory experiments. the system is to be i n t e r a c t i v e   drawing on both the expertise of the human geneticist and the expert knowledge stored in the data base. in addition to the knowledge base  the major components of the computer system w i l l be an experimental planning program  an enzyme simulation program  and dna structure entry and e d i t i n g system. extensive use of h e u r i s t i c and other  reasoning  strategies at decision points in the programs make t h i s a research project in i n t e l l i g e n t systems. 
1. curvature and convexity in scene 
analysis problems 
this study w i l l investigate the i n t e r relationships that e x i s t among various parameters of surfaces in scenes and how they affect the information that is recorded in pictures of these surfaces. special a t t e n t i o n w i l l be focused on the effects of surface curvature and convexity  or concavity  and the mutual interactions of these parameters and those that are associated with the d i r e c t i o n of the i l l u mination  the o r i e n t a t i o n of the surface and i t s texture and l i g h t r e f l e c t i n g c h a r a c t e r i s t i e s . 
1. techniques for the representation of 
movement-related information using a d i g i t a l computer 
the long-range goal of t h i s project is computer recognition and descript i o n of patterns of human movement. 
as a step toward that goal  research 
is being conducted on a computationally suitable notational system to serve as a low-level language for description of human movement. the notational system is event-oriented  rather than t i m e - i n t e r v a l oriented  and the events themselves are p r i m a r i l y symbolic  rather than numeric; that i s   s i g n i f i c a n t events are indicated by changes in sematic r e l a t i o n s rather than in numerical q u a n t i t i e s . a related focus is the design and implementation of data and control structures appropriate to the description and manipulation of information related to human movement which may then provide a basis f o r an appropriate lowl e v e l programming language. 
automation  bioengineering and sensing systems program 
the automation  bioengineering and sensing systems program supports research in the engineering sciences related to the general area of machine decision and c o n t r o l . although t h i s subset of the 
program is referred to as advanced automation  the research overlaps i n t o topics generally thought of as a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l ligence. technical areas include sensing systems  imaging systems to generate or enhance v i s i o n of p i c t u r e s   pattern recogn i t i o n and processing  feature e x t r a c t i o n   learning systems  feedback decision and c o n t r o l   and robotics and manipulator research. the objective is to develop fundamental knowledge concerning the techniques inherent in automated machine decision making independent of the problem domain. therefore  the automation  bioengineering and sensing systems program is driven by the engineering science involved and not by any s p e c i f i c problem or goal and the i n d i v i d u a l projects span a wide range of i n v e s t i g a t i o n s . 
in sensing systems research  areas of i n v e s t i g a t i o n include physical or chemical sensors  laser ranging  electromagnetic or acoustical probing of physical or b i o l o g i c a l systems  and nuclear imaging. holography  u l t r a s o n i c   o p t i c a l   and other imaging techniques are studied both experimentally and t h e o r e t i c a l l y in various problem domains. pattern recognition and processing is a major portion of the advanced automation area  with emphasis on scene analysis by means of motion  c o l o r   texture or other parameters  and applications of syntactic pattern recognition methods. in the case of robotics or mani p u l a t o r research  primary i n t e r e s t l i e s in the automatic coordination of j o i n t motion under computer c o n t r o l   u t i l i z i n g 
invited panel-ls gevarter 1 feedback techniques. although these investigations have a p p l i c a b i l i t y to i n d u s t r i a l manipulators  prosthetic devices  legged locomotion  muscle-skeleton problems and others  the research concentrates on 
the basic understanding of the mechanisms of j o i n t motion and feedback control and u t i l i z e s computer simulation  kinematic 
models  and experimental techniques. investigators supported by the automation  bioengineering and sensing systems program perform t h e o r e t i c a l and experimental r e search  computer modeling and simulation  and studies of the complete system. 
some representative grants from t h i s program are: 
1. use of range and t r i s p e c t r a l reflectance data in scene analysis 
this research focuses on the use of registered t r i s p e c t r a l reflectance and range data of d i f f e r e n t indoor scenes  developing procedures for extracting geometrical and v i s u a l features to recognition of threedimensional objectives by a highl e v e l computer program with some knowledge of the environment. s p e c i f i c a l l y   the program w i l l seek to establish geometrical and r e flectance models for objectives with d i f f e r e n t shape  size  and surface spectral reflectance. feature ex*t r a c t i o n w i l l be accomplished by applying the registered range and reflectance data to objects with planar and nonplanar surfaces. 
1. research on space-variant optical computers 
this program of research on spacevariant o p t i c a l computers involves two major phases. the primary e f f o r t during t h i s f i r s t year w i l l be aimed at o p t i c a l techniques for performing coordinate transformations. this w i l l include s p e c i f i c a l l y : an i n vestigation of the c a p a b i l i t i e s and l i m i t a t i o n s of the methods conceived of by bryngdahl; a search for a l t e r native methods using computer generated holograms but not subject to severe space-bandwidth product l i m i tations of the curved-input-outputsurface method; a search for new o p t i c a l methods of any kind for performing space-variant linear f i l t e r i n g ; and development of e x p e r i mental experience w i t h the known methods. the second phase of the program w i l l be devoted to spacevariant o p t i c a l f i l t e r i n g of various kinds of data. 
1. theory of pattern processing using new charge-coupled device architectures 
the central objective of t h i s research is to establish pattern processing theory for charge coupled device processor architecture to be used in advanced automation. this can be divided i n t o more s p e c i f i c object i v e s t h a t include devising fundament a l architectures for ccd and microprocessor-based advanced automation systems  establishing signal processing algorithms t h a t are best suited for decision and control in such architectures  studies of unique signal processing p o s s i b i l i t i e s such as r e g i s t r a t i o n   d i l a t i o n   i l l u m i n a t i o n v a r i a t i o n and ranging  and v e r i f i c a t i o n of results  to the extent 
possible  using e x i s t i n g experimental systems. the approach w i l l emphasize general solutions so as to have broad a p p l i c a b i l i t y . 
production research and technology program 
the production research and technology program's purview is the production system  i . e .   the way goods are manufactured and produced. it is concerned with research on the technical problems which underlie both the physical transformations of objects and the informational transformations necessary to understand  model  cont r o l and carry out manufacturing operations. the program recognizes that major modifications in manufacturing leading to quantum jumps in p r o d u c t i v i t y would be hastened if such a science base could be established and applied. 
the f i r s t i n d u s t r i a l revolution involved the transfer of s k i l l s from man to machine and much has been accomplished in t h i s area. the second i n d u s t r i a l r e v o l u t i o n   which is in i t s infancy  involves the transfer of i n t e l l i g e n c e from man to machine. the production research and technology program is concerned with i d e n t i f y i n g and understanding those research problems whose solution is necessary to accomplish t h i s transfer of i n t e l l i g e n c e from man to machine in the area of manufacturing. 
the program's objectives include: 
o promotion of problem-oriented research in bottleneck areas  where modest r e search investments can have high leverage in improving p r o d u c t i v i t y . 
o promotion of more fundamental  but s t i l l problem-oriented  research aimed at establishing a science base for manufacturing.

are to devise and implement an advanced programmable/adaptable automation system with a p p l i c a b i l i t y to large important classes of material handling  inspection  and assembly processes for batch-production discrete part manufactured products. two groups of tasks are planned: the major group includes goal-oriented research i n t o advanced vision and maniputation techniques aimed at s i g n i f i cantly extending the adaptive capabili t i e s of i n d u s t r i a l robots and providing s i m p l i f i e d programming c a p a b i l i t i e s for automated visual inspection. the second group of tasks is to devise and implement software moduleb widely useful for computerized visual sensing  visual inspection and sensor controlled manipu l a t i o n using standard hardware. these modules w i l l reduce to practice past research results and make the research readily available to industry. research to be pursued includes: development of minimally i n t e r a c t i v e methods to automatically generate computer programs for the visual inspection of parts and subassemblies by   t r a i n i n g by showing;  use of s o l i d state cameras to explore v i s u a l feedback of manipulators to positioning a robot and effector  hand  in real time; use of visual and t a c t i l e sensor feedback to accomplish precision 
manipulations; use of both range and i n t e n s i t y information requiring faster and more powerful image processing algorithms to apply to complex inspect i o n problems to widen the u t i l i t y of visual sensing. 
1. general methods to enable robots with  vision  to acquire  orient and transport workpieces 
this research e f f o r t seeks to develop general methods by which computercontrolled robots using visual sensors can  1  acquire a workpiece  part  so that it may be brought to a f i x t u r e without a c o l l i s i o n ;  1  compute the o r i e n t a t i o n of a workpiece held in the robot hand; and  1  transport the workpiece to the f i x t u r e without c o l l i s i o n s . the research is expected to result in new image processing techniques as w e l l as kinematic equations for manipulators and robot system architecture which w i l l enable a class of presently unsolvable i n d u s t r i a l problems to be attacked. 
planned a c t i v i t i e s include the f o l l o w i n g : methods to acquire and orient workpieces with a r b i t r a r y resting states w i l l be developed. features which describe workpieces' orientation w i l l be i n v e s t i gated. some of these features w i l l be based on a p a r t i a l image of the workpiece and others on the complete image.

recognized by i n d u s t r i a l research magazine in i t s annual ir-1 competition as  one of the 1 most s i g n i f i c a n t new technical products of year 1.  cmac was considered important for a number of reasons: 
f i r s t   it reduces a s i g n i f i c a n t new neurophysiological theory to a mathematical formalism of s u f f i c i e n t precision to make possible s c i e n t i f i c predictions of motor behavior. 
second  it is a new technique of computer memory management which makes p r a c t i c a l the real time computation of a large class of important m u l t i v a r i a n t functions by table look-up. this class of functions includes those frequently encountered in the servo control of machine t o o l s   robots  aerospace vehicles  and many i n d u s t r i a l processes. 
t h i r d   it is a device which can be implemented w i t h inexpensive microprocessor technology thereby making i t s use economi c a l for a wide v a r i e t y of control system applications. 
fourth  it is a device which can be i n t e r connected in a h i e r a r c h i c a l structure so as to generate sensory-interactive  adapt i v e   goal-directed behavior in autonomous systems. cmac provides an e n t i r e l y new approach to many s i g n i f i c a n t problems in a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e   data base management  and large scale d i s t r i b u t e d computing systems. 
the nbs automation technology program is currently funded at $1k per year. this is expected to r i s e to $1 m i l l i o n in fy 1 and to about $1 by 1. of t h i s funding approximately 1% is devoted to developing sensors and control technology.

the office of naval research supports two major research e f f o r t s in a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e :  1  large f i l e systems and  1  maintenance automation. 
i. 	large f i l e systems 
the non-numeric large f i l e problem  most c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of c i v i l i a m and m i l i t a r y l o g i s t i c s   management  f i n a n c i a l   and 
personnel and data processing environments  is the problem area most poorly addressed by current computer technology. the r e quirement here  barely touched upon by research a c t i v i t y to the time of 1  is the development of techniques to improve search and runtime e f f i c i e n c y ; to design software which faces up to security issues in a highly i n t e r a c t i v e   network environ-
ment; to accomplish a major breakthrough by moving away from systems which produce calendar oriented  voluminous output; and to move vigorously toward the t o a l of r e a l time i n t e r a c t i o n between decision makers and stored data. in spite of almost twenty years of heralding the a r r i v a l of on-line computing  our current systems are largely batch o r i e n t e d ; output is voluminous and calendar d i r e c t e d ; management by exception seldom occurs; there is very l i t t l e d i r e c t   on-line manager i n t e r a c t i o n with computers. large data base research a c t i v i t y   i n i t i a t e d by the office of naval research in 1  set out to develop a body of techniques for correcting these deficiencies.. most important  the onr program had the larger goal of moving computation from i t s current state of c o n s t i t u t i n g a passive capability - a l l of t h a t data s i t t i n g there in storage waiting to be asked questions which are seldom or never asked. the 1 objective 
was to push strongly in the d i r e c t i o n of a c t i v i s t systems which are capable of carrying on extensive english language dialogues  which have an automated capacity for comprehending relationships across data  for making inferences  for using that faci l i t y t o take i n i t i a t i v e   i n real time  t o a l e r t managers to the impending occurrence of c r i t i c a l events. knowledge systems used to anticipate and prevent c r i s i s   not computers used to reconstruct the history of past disasters is the ultimate large data base research o b j e c t i v e . large f i l e system research has two major aspects; one being the design of software to f a c i l i t a t e the managerial data r e t r i e v a l process; the other  being the creation of mechanisms to improve managerial - data base i n t e r a c t i o n . from the software design perspective  the program includes such elements as privacy and selective access control c a p a b i l i t i e s ; procedures for automatic reconfiguration of f i l e s across storage media; the i n c l u sion of smoothing algorithms to control the reconfiguration process; the routine creat i o n of   u t i l i t y f i l e s   containing summary data; data s t r u c t u r i n g t o f a c i l i t a t e i n f e r e n t i a l search; the capability for providing statements on the accuracy or r e levance of output; the incorporation of knowledge representation methodologies to create a context for i n t e r p r e t i n g the meanings of interrogations a r r i v i n g from diverse sources. from the user perspect i v e   the research includes real time i n t e r r o g a t i o n ; on-line modeling c a p a b i l i t i e s ; a t e x t reading  text summarization  and message p r i o r i t i z a t i o n c a p a b i l i t y ; the development of a natural language f r o n t end to enable d i r e c t contact with computers by high l e v e l managers - t h i s i n t e r a c t i o n ranging from  one l i n e r s   to sophisticated on-line browsing and simulation; b u i l d i n g a c a p a b i l i t y for a n t i c i p a t i n g c r i s i s s i t -

i i . maintenance automation 
the increasing technological complexity of naval weapons systems  coupled with a n t i c ipated shortages of required manpower s k i l l s and r i s i n g repair costs  underscore the i n e v i t a b i l i t y of an impending d i f f i c u l t s i t u a t i o n in fleet maintenance. automat i o n of navy maintenance a c t i v i t i e s is proposed  not as a substitute f o r   but as a necessary adjunct to solving the problem by increasing the manpower supply  or improving the fundamental r e l i a b i l i t y of weapons. 
research objectives include: 
a. automating the processes 	of equip-
ment f a i l u r e diagnosis and repair  i n c l u d ing:  1  use of the computer as an  expert consultant  to the technician in performing general diagnosis and repair.  1  developing f u l l y automated diagnostics and repair c a p a b i l i t i e s for selected equipment areas.  1  exploring p o s s i b i l i t i e s of computer assisted jury r i g advice for classes of malfunctions.  1  where feasible  developing automated procedures for i n i t i a t ing/accomplishing jury r i g solutions. 
b. automating the function of manufac-
t u r i n g required for unavailable spare parts  including:  1  development of automated  onboard manufacturing c a p a b i l i t i e s . poss i b i l i t i e s range from use of numerically controlled machines to design of a . i . procedures for one-of-a-kind production.  1  consideration of stocking rough f i n ished  general u t i l i t y   modules which  
with a . i . manufacturing  can be t a i l o r e d to a unique end item need. 
c. the design of a . i . procedures for 
automating the function of t e s t i n g for d e t e r i o r a t i o n   damage  or miscalibration of on-the-shelf stocked items. 
d. mechanizing the function of equip-
ment condition monitoring; the i n t e r e s t being that of automatic alarm ringing when pre-established threshold conditions are breached. 
e. the e x p l o i t a t i o n of a . i . viewing and 
manipulation c a p a b i l i t i e s to reduce both damage and manpower requirements for onboard ship materials handling and movement. 
f. design of generalized  automated 
devices for accomplishing manpower i n t e n sive shipboard housekeeping functions. 
g. the design of a . i . knowledge base  
process modelling c a p a b i l i t i e s to schedule and monitor the t o t a l i t y of maintenance 
a c t i v i t i e s relevant to operating embarked c a r r i e r squadrons. 
the f i e l d of a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e has produced fundamental results in the areas of machine conceptualizing  machine v i s i o n   and manipulation; these results are so promising as to indicate the a d v i s a b i l i t y of a large investment to t e s t the appropriaten e s s / f e a s i b i l i t y of these techniques for addressing the issues described above. very recent results demonstrated the u t i l i t y of a . i . algorithms f o r :  1  understanding and responding to natural language questions on the w i r i n g i n t r i c a c i e s of a complex c i r c u i t design  and  1  automatic recognition and underscoring of c i r c u i t malfunctions  and  1  automated guidance to technicians on accomplishing the repair.

the need for a . i . technology is increasing rapidly in the department of defense in general and the navy in p a r t i c u l a r . while the nature of the navy's r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s becomes more d i f f i c u l t and the equipment becomes more sophisticated almost d a i l y   the a b i l i t y of the navy to f u l f i l l i t s missions has not f u l l y kept pace. there are a number of reasons for t h i s   the most s i g n i f i c a n t of which are: 
1. the people in the m i l i t a r y are costly and yet mostly u n s k i l l e d . the amount of the m i l i t a r y budget spent on personnel has increased to 1%  and is l i k e l y to increase further with the continuation of the a l l volunteer m i l i t a r y   yet due to some of the disadvantages of m i l i t a r y service  it is d i f f i c u l t to draw and keep s u f f i c i e n t s k i l l e d labor to operate  maintain  and repair the widespread sophisticated equipment. 
1. the t r a i n i n g of people to handle and repair sophisticated m i l i t a r y equipment is very expensive. 	once t r a i n e d   many m i l i tary people can obtain substantially higher salaries in private enterprise and therefore often leave before the m i l i t a r y has f u l l y recovered the costs of t h e i r t r a i n i n g . 
1. machines can operate in environments h o s t i l e to people  for example  under f i r e or in extreme climates or  for certain navy applications  under water. 
invited panel-1: gevarter 1 1. successful operation of the modern m i l i t a r y complex requires e f f e c t i v e   e f f i c i e n t   and rapid command and control of a large complex of people and equipment. however  the systems for command and control have 
not f u l l y kept pace with the rapid advances in the equipment being commanded and cont r o l l e d . 
1. skilled humans can s t i l l far outperform computers in many aspects of processing tasks  such as those associated with noisy signals from radar  radio  and acoustic equipment. many other tasks such as the handling of day to day reports and mounds of paperwork can be more e f f e c t i v e l y handled by computers. it is therefore important that useful and trustworthy systems be made available to free m i l i t a r y personnel for those tasks for which humans are best suited. 
while it is true that the cost of computer software  expecially a . i . type software  is r i s i n g rapidly  the potential benefits from successful a . i . techniques far out-
weigh the i n i t i a l costs. 
the a . i . r&d at nrl is essentially concentrated in the computer science laboratory in the communications sciences division. the three f u l l - t i m e senior computer scientists have published more than f i f t y refereed journal a r t i c l e s and a book  slagle  1 . these publications have been in computer science in general with the main thrust in a . i . encompassing automatic clustering  pattern recognition  deduction  heuristic search  symbol manipu l a t i o n   and i n t e l l i g e n t knowledge base management. the current  fiscal 1  budget is $1. next year  it is expected to exceed $1  a portion of which w i l l go to outside contractors at u n i v e r s i t i e s   etc. current project areas of i n t e r e s t   ordered by increasing funding l e v e l   are automatic speech compression  robotics  i n t e l l i g e n t knowledge-based management systems  and clustering and pattern recognition. these projects w i l l now be discussed. 
the objective of the speech compression project is to develop a technique to enable low b i t rate speech communication with 
minimum loss of q u a l i t y . the main navy application is to intersubmarine communicat i o n . the approach in t h i s laboratory has been based on the use of alophones-small i d e n t i f i a b l e segments of speech similar to but more numerous than phonemes. if speech can be represented by a manageable number of alophones and be f u l l y reconstructable  then the amount of data required to transmit the speech can be greatly reduced. using d i g i t i z e d speech in the form of l i n ear predictive coding  lpc  coefficients  we are applying cluster analysis techniques to determine candidate sets of alophones for vowel sounds in english. 
the purpose of the robotics project is to investigate the f e a s i b i l i t y of employing a mechanical arm for automated underwater tasks on an unmanned  free swimming vehicle. techniques are being developed for the accomplishment of useful tasks without the use of television images or large complements of computers. viable types of sensory feedback  dynamically alterable planning strategies  and information representations must be developed for this program to succeed. as an i n i t i a l experiment a l t o o l for this research  we have acquired a model  mit robot arm  such as the one shown in figure 1. we w i l l acquire  design and build sensors as needed. 

we are developing an i n t e l l i g e n t knowledgebase management system with the following c a p a b i l i t i e s : 
1. a b i l i t y to handle very large knowledge bases  order of a b i l l i o n or more b i t s   . 
1. a b i l i t y to do both e x p l i c i t and i m p l i c i t  inferential  	question answering. 
1. compact information representation. 
1. utilizes semantic  domain specific  i n formation for both better control of the knowledge base search and inference processes and to assist in maintaining knowledge base i n t e g r i t y . 
we are now in the process of  bringing up  the f i r s t version of the system for parallel representation of knowledge  spark  on the dec-1 computer system at nrl. experiments employing r e a l i s t i c navy knowledge bases w i l l be performed with the system to determine i t s u t i l i t y and benefits. 
we are investigating automatic clustering and pattern recognition from a basic r e search and applied point of view. 	our 
main application is emission i d e n t i f i c a t i o n - the process of identifying unfriendly 	planes  ships  etc. by means of the 

invited panel-1: gevarter 1 

passive acquisition of data such as their radar and radio signals. the objective of the automatic emission i d e n t i f i c a t i o n project is to employ clustering*and pattern recognition techniques to automate the process of i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of objects by class  that is to identify ships  for example  by t h e i r type but not by name  using data collected from a variety of remote sensing devices.

1. natural language in this area arpa funds: 
a. story-understanding research 
b. better man-machine dialogue i n t e r -action research 
1. knowledge based reasoning systems 
research in t h i s area includes work on production rule formalisms  rule-based systems . production systems they have helped support include mycin  a diagnostic system for i d e n t i f y i n g bacteria blood infections and antibody prescription  and dendral  a q u a l i t a t i v e chemi c a l analyses system using mass spec-
tronomy . research continues on i n ference-based systems that can do reasoning and are self-documenting   i n d i cating how results were obtained . interest is also evolving on learning  whereby the computer can acquire i t s own models and rules empirically. 1. computer vision systerns 
research in t h i s area is centered on trying to develop automatic recognition and extraction of features from scenes.
