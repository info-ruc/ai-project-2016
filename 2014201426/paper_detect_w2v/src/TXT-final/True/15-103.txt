       we then proceed to describe how such a system may be constructed by b u i l d i n g a machine which c o n t i n u a l l y t r i e s to reduce its own u n c e r t a i n t y regarding the outcome of its a c t i o n s . an implementation which learns to perform a m u l t i p l e concept learning task in the presence of noisy data i s b r i e f l y d e s c r i b e d . 
1: 	introduction 
       at present the successes achieved by various knowledge-based al systems can only be a t t a i n e d through a considerable e f f o r t by human experts who supply the necessary knowledge in a s u i t a b l y organized form. the notion of a knowledge-based system endowed w i t h the a b i l i t y to acquire i t s own knowledge base is thus becoming i n c r e a s i n g l y a t t r a c t i v e . 
       a l t e r n a t i v e d e f i n i t i o n s are p o s s i b l e . one could for example define learning as the c o n s t r u c t i o n of an organized r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of experience. this d e f i n i t i o n is complementary to simon's since it s p e c i f i e s the means but makes no reference to the end. the two d e f i n i t i o n s provide a l t e r n a t i v e viewpoints from which the same system can be regarded. 
       these a l t e r n a t i v e viewpoints suggest d i f f e r e n t approaches to c o n s t r u c t i n g a learning machine. simon's d e f i n i t i o n suggests a system which repeatedly attempts to perform some task and  on the basis of the r e s u l t s of each attempt  makes some changes in i t s internal o r g a n i s a t i o n . the e f f e c t of these changes should be a steady improvement in the systems's performance at that task. most machine learning systems f o l l o w t h i s paradigm which we s h a l l term 'task-oriented 
learni ng' . 
       defining l e a r n i n g as the c o n s t r u c t i o n of an organized r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of experience suggests a d i f f e r e n t kind of learning machine. this would be a system which repeatedly i n t e r a c t e d w i t h i t s environment and b u i l t an i n t e r n a l model which summarised i t s experiences. in such a system there would be no attempt to improve performance at any p a r t i c u l a r task. we s h a l l term t h i s 'knowledgeor iented l e a r n i n g ' . 
       is it p o s s i b l e to construct a knowledgeo r i e n t e d learning system  could it learn anything useful  would it ever have advantages over a tasko r i e n t e d l e a r n i n g system  under what circumstances  the remainder of t h i s paper attempts to answer these q u e s t i o n s . 
1: an analogy 
       
       much of the research on machine learning  appears to be based on the same basic assumption regarding the nature of l e a r n i n g . this assumption has been s u c c i n c t l y expressed in simon's  d e f i n i t i o n of learning as any process by which a system improves i t s performance. note t h a t t h i s d e f i n e s what learning is f o r   and thus views l e a r n i n g as any means for achieving a p a r t i c u l a r end  rather than attempting to s p e c i f y what l e a r n i ng a c t u a l l y i s . 
*we thank the nsf and horace h. rackham school of graduate studies for f i n a n c i a l support. 
       we begin w i t h an analogy. science is a process by which people have c o l l e c t i v e l y developed a l o g i c a l   integrated and s e l f c o n s i s t e n t model of events which occur in the physical w o r l d . it has two complementary aspects. one is technology: those i n v e s t i g a t i o n s designed to achieve a p a r t i c u l a r p r a c t i c a l g o a l . the other aspect is pure science: those i n v e s t i g a t i o n s intended only to extend our understanding of the way the observable world works. even a s l i g h t acquaintance w i t h the development of s c i e n t i f i c 
       thought reveals that these two aspects are 
       
inseparable. each is e s s e n t i a l l y dependent on the o t h e r . 
       technology is society operating a tasko r i e n t e d learning s t r a t e g y . s i m i l a r l y pure science is society operating a knowledge-oriented learning s t r a t e g y . since the two are complementary processes in society we should s e r i o u s l y examine the p o s s i b i l i t y that the same may be true for 
machine learning systems. we shall therefore pursue the analogy in order to c l a r i f y the r o l e of knowledge-oriented l e a r n i n g . 
       suppose that in 1 some government had asked i t s s c i e n t i f i c academy to invent a device for t r a n s m i t t i n g p i c t u r e s r a p i d l y over large d i s t a n c e s . this hypothetical t a s k - o r i e n t e d learning assignment illuminates several important poi n t s . 
       f i r s t it is absurd since the p r o j e c t was not t e c h n i c a l l y f e a s i b l e in 1 and would have been regarded as impossible. the pure s c i e n t i f i c endeavours of faraday  maxwell  hertz and thompson were necessary precursors of t e l e v i s i o n . only when knowledge-oriented learning had created a r i c h enough model of the physical world could tasko r i e n t e d learning be used to achieve the p r a c t i c a l end. 
       second  it is doubtful if those eminent p h y s i c i s t s would have done the research they did if t h e i r goal had been a remote viewing system. it is even more doubtful that a government concerned to acquire such a system would have continued to fund such t h e o r e t i c a l work. the r e s u l t s obtained by knowledge-directed learning do not necessarily y i e l d r e s u l t s which are immediately or obviously u s e f u l . 
       t h i r d   the knowledge of electromagnetic phenomena obtained in the nineteenth century has not only served as the basis for one p a r t i c u l a r invention but is fundamental to much of today's 
technology. 	the 	long term b e n e f i t s of knowledge-
o r i e n t e d learning may have a much more fundamental u t i l i t y than the r e s u l t s of task-oriented learni ng. 
       this analogy is open to several o b j e c t i o n s . f i r s t   fundamental advances in pure science were achieved by some of the w o r l d ' s most i n t e l l i g e n t people. ai has not reached the stage where we can endow our creations w i t h such a b i l i t i e s . this o b j e c t i o n is countered by observing that a l l humans and some animals make extensive use of knowledge-oriented learning during t h e i r early l i v e s in order to acquire motor  perceptual  c o g n i t i v e and social s k i l l s . the same strategy which is d i g n i f i e d as 'science' when it occurs in a laboratory is dismissed as 'play* when observed

in a nursery. 
       a second o b j e c t i o n would argue that while knowledge-oriented learning is needed for fundamental advances it has a n e g l i g i b l e r o l e in most of our learning a c t i v i t i e s . like the previous o b j e c t i o n t h i s may be refuted by the extensive use of play as a learning s t r a t e g y . indeed t h i s suggests that knowledge-oriented learning y i e l d s benefits which are not achievable by other means.  for f u r t h e r discussion of play viewed as knowledge-oriented learning see  and   . 
       a t h i r d o b j e c t i o n would be that we want learning machines to learn something we regard as u s e f u l . any system which acquires knowledge without an e x t e r n a l l y s p e c i f i e d goal w i l l e i t h e r b u i l d a r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of something i r r e l e v a n t to the user's needs or  more l i k e l y   accumulate a morass of unrelated observations and spurious c o r r e l a t i o n s . we propose to r e f u t e t h i s o b j e c t i o n by d e s c r i b i n g the c o n s t r u c t i o n of a system which uses knowledge-oriented learning to b u i l d a useful r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of i t s environment. 
1: searching for certainty 
       as noted e a r l i e r   science attempts to construct a l o g i c a l   integrated and s e l f consistent world model. this is subject to continual c o r r e c t i o n so long as it remains e i t h e r incorrect or incomplete. if it is i n c o r r e c t it leads to erroneous p r e d i c t i o n s . if it is incomplete there are s i t u a t i o n s whose outcome cannot be p r e d i c t e d . thus the model needs modifying whenever something unexpected happens. 
       this p r i n c i p l e may be used as the basis for b u i l d i n g a machine which w i l l c o n s t r u c t a representation of i t s environment. such a machine would i n t e r a c t w i t h i t s world in an organised and purposeful f a s h i o n . its underlying goal would be to avoid being s u r p r i s e d   not by avoiding novelty but by c o n s t r u c t i n g a model which enabled it to predict the outcome of a l l i t s a c t i o n s . 
       this is a special kind of g o a l . in seeking an ordinary goal a system is attempting to change i t s environment. to do t h i s it uses a r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of that environment. in c o n t r a s t   in c o n s t r u c t i n g a model to e l i m i n a t e s u r p r i s e a system is t r y i n g to change i t s r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of the environment. to do t h i s it would use knowledge about that r e p r e s e n t a t i o n . for example it must have some r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of i t s own ignorance: the region of u n c e r t a i n t y on the borders of i t s knowledge. such a r e p r e s e n t a t i o n would be a form of metaknowledge. 
       this metaknowledge need not be sophisticated to form the basis of a successful knowledge-

1. select least c e r t a i n item in knowledge base. 
1. perform some a c t i o n whose outcome w i l l s u b s t a n t i a t e o r d i s c r e d i t that item.   i e . do an experiment  
1. change knowledge base  including c e r t a i n t y measures  in accord w i t h outcome of experiment. 
1. goto 1 
such a system would c o n t i n u a l l y reduce the u n c e r t a i n t y i n i t s o r i g i n a l r e p r e s e n t a t i o n . however the changes introduced in step 1 may well give r i s e to f u r t h e r areas of u n c e r t a i n t y which w i l l themselves be subsequently reduced. 
       note that the system must s t a r t w i t h an i n i t i a l r e p r e s e n t a t i o n . this could be e i t h e r very simple  as in the example f o l l o w i n g   or very e l a b o r a t e   in which case the learning system would proceed t o r e f i n e i t . 
1: pan : an implementation 
       we have w r i t t e n a program c a l l e d pan to demonstrate that a knowledge-oriented learning system can be constructed using these ideas. space l i m i t a t i o n s r e s t r i c t us to sketching some of the main features of the system but a d e t a i l e d account w i l l be found in   1   . pan is a simulated robot operating in a simple environment c a l l e d panworld which consists of a c o l l e c t i o n of o b j e c t s . pan can d i s t i n g u i s h these o b j e c t s on the basis of various a t t r i b u t e s such as c o l o r   s i z e   t e x t u r e and shape. in a d d i t i o n pan can detect when an object moves. 
       pan can perform f i v e d i f f e r e n t operations on i n d i v i d u a l o b j e c t s : push  pick-up  kick  zap and woggle. the outcome of an o p e r a t i o n is determined by a set of rules c a l l e d panphysics which are chosen by the experimenter. these r u l e s may be e i t h e r d e t e r m i n i s t i c or s t o c h a s t i c . a t y p i c a l d e t e r m i n i s t i c r u l e i s : -
only o b j e c t s which are large and rough move if woggled. 
a t y p i c a l 	s t o c h a s t i c r u l e 	i s : -
p r o b a b i l i t y t h a t smooth object moves if pushed is 1 . 1 . 
	p r o b a b i l i t y 	t h a t 	non-smooth object moves 	if 
	pushed 	is 1 . 1 . 
stochastic rules would create serious problems for many concept learning systems but they are r e a d i l y discovered by pan. 
       pan attempts to construct a representation which w i l l enable it to p r e d i c t the outcome of applying any of i t s operations to any o b j e c t . such knowledge is of obvious u t i l i t y in problems o l v i n g . it does t h i s by developing a hierarchy of classes of o b j e c t s . i n i t i a l l y t h i s hierarchy comprises the s i n g l e class 'things' of which every object is an instance. subsequent classes are subclasses of t h i s class and membership comprises those o b j e c t s possessing a d i s t i n g u i s h i n g set of 
a t t r ibute 	values. 
       attached to each class is a set of o p e r a t i o n s . these are those operations which pan believes w i l l r e s u l t in any object in that class moving. this representation was d e l i b e r a t e l y modelled on object-based languages such as s m a l l t a l k . associated w i t h each a c t i o n in each class is an estimate of the p r o b a b i l i t y that an instance of that class w i l l move if that operation i s applied t o i t . i n i t i a l l y a l l operations are attached to the class 'things' w i t h associated p r o b a b i l i t y 1. 
       the measure of u n c e r t a i n t y used to d r i v e pan is derived from the p r o b a b i l i t y estimate. we used shannon's information f u n c t i o n  in a n t i c i p a t i o n of extending the system to experiments w i t h many p o s s i b l e outcomes but other functions could be used to produce s i m i l a r r e s u l t s . 
       the operation of pan f o l l o w s the scheme discussed above. f i r s t the least c e r t a i n item in the knowledge base is chosen. this is the o p e r a t i o n which is attached to a class w i t h highest u n c e r t a i n t y . an experiment is then performed. the o p e r a t i o n is applied to a randomly chosen instance of that c l a s s . the object w i l l e i t h e r move or remain s t a t i o n a r y . 
       if it moves the current representation appears to be c o r r e c t so the only change made is an increment in the corresponding p r o b a b i l i t y est imate. 
       if the o b j e c t does not move the system has generated an i n c o r r e c t p r e d i c t i o n . the corresponding p r o b a b i l i t y estimate is decremented. the class hierarchy is also modified in one of two ways. if the r e s u l t i n g p r o b a b i l i t y is lower than the p r o b a b i l i t y w i t h which the operation is attached to the superclass of the class then the o p e r a t i o n is detached from the c l a s s . classes w i t h o u t subclasses or attached operations are d e l e t e d . 
　　　　　　if however the r e s u l t i n g p r o b a b i l i t y is s t i l l higher than that in the superclass pan concludes that some but not a l l of the current class w i l l move when the operation is a p p l i e d . it therefore attempts to construct a subclass of the current c l a s s   a l l of whose members move when the a c t i o n is a p p l i e d . it applies the o p e r a t i o n to instances of the current class u n t i l it f i n d s one that moves. an a t t r i b u t e value of t h i s o b j e c t is added to the a t t r i b u t e values which d i s t i n g u i s h members of the current class to form the d i s t i n g u i s h i n g a t t r i b u t e values for the new subclass. the a c t i o n is then attached to the new subclass. 
       the system then begins a new c y c l e . this process continues u n t i l a l l the u n c e r t a i n t y values in the system drop below a threshold value which 
t y p i c a l l y corresponds to p r o b a b i l i t y estimates of 1 and 1. at t h i s point pan has a great deal of confidence about the l i k e l y outcome of any experiment. since it does not seek absolute c e r t a i n t y and since i t s only memory of previous experiments is in the form of p r o b a b i l i t y estimates it is not s e n s i t i v e to low l e v e l s of indeterminism in panphysics. higher l e v e l s of indeterminism prevent the system reaching i t s c e r t a i n t y thresholds but the system s t i l l b u i l d s a r e p r e s e n t a t i o n which c o r r e c t l y r e f l e c t s the 
i n t r i n s i c 	u n c e r t a i n t y of 	i t s 	environment. 
1: 	conclusion 
       pan is a simple system which demonstrates that a knowledge-oriented learning s t r a t e g y   based on knowledge of i t s own u n c e r t a i n t y   works well on a m u l t i p l e concept learning task in the presence of noisy data. 
       it is i n t e r e s t i n g to compare it w i t h another much more s o p h i s t i c a t e d learning program: am  see   1     . am s t a r t s w i t h some knowledge of f i n i t e sets and proceeds to discover much of number t h e o r y . it is a knowledge-oriented learning system since it is not t r y i n g to improve i t s performance. it simply explores those combinations which appear 
' i n t e r e s t i n g ' . am includes 1 h e u r i s t i c s to assess ' i n t e r e s t i n g n e s s ' and these play the same r o l e as the u n c e r t a i n t y measure in pan. 
       there is c l e a r l y considerable scope for the development of both other pure knowledge-oriented systems and hybrid systems which e x p l o i t both learning s t r a t e g i e s .
