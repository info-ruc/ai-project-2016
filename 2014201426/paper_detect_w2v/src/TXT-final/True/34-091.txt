m o s t r e s e a r c h in robotics is d i r e c t e d t o w a r d the understanding of cognitive processes. but robotics is also an i m p o r t a n t technological d i s c i pline w i t h p r a g m a t i c issues to be a n s w e r e d . this paper is addressed to these issues  and p a r t i c u l a r l y to the basic c o n f l i c t at the core of studies in integrated s y s t e m s : w h i l e the r e s e a r c h task is anticipated to be a long and d i f f i c u l t one  it is also expected to y i e l d some p r a c t i c a l results in the near future. the paper considers a design and i m p l e m e n t a t i o n scheme that p r o v i d e s an answer to this c o n f l i c t . it introduces a s t r u c t u r e d approach for the i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of a v i r t u a l robot. t h i s approach p r o v i d e s a n i n v a r i ant s t r u c t u r e for a s y s t e m under continuous development  and a method by w h i c h the robot can p e r f o r m useful tasks d u r i n g its development. the design is c u r r e n t l y being applied to the j p l / caltech robot for planetary e x p l o r a t i o n   and in p a r a l l e l t o l o n g - t e r m studies  i t w i l l p r o v i d e

     m o s t r e s e a r c h w o r k i n robotics i s addressed to one aspect or another of a robotic s y s t e m  1 . h o w e v e r   the design and i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of a c o m p l e t e l y i n t e g r a t e d s y s t e m m u s t also consider the global aspects of the s y s t e m s t r u c t u r e and the p r a c t i c a l aspects of i m p l e m e n t a t i o n . the i n t e g r a t i o n of many c o m p l e x processes  many of w h i c h are s t i l l not w e l l understood  m u s t fit into an i m p l e m e n t a t i o n f r a m e w o r k that a l l o w s smooth i n t e g r a t i o n of c o m p l e t e d modules along w i t h the i n t e g r a t i o n of the processes that are s t i l l under study. 
     e a r l y w o r k in robotics recognized the need for such a f r a m e w o r k   and some of the p r o b l e m s have been addressed  1  1  1 . h o w e v e r   l a t e r w o r k on i n t e g r a t e d systems  and in p a r t i c u l a r studies p e r f o r m e d at sri  stanford u n i v e r s i t y   the u n i v e r s i t y of e d i n b u r g h   and in japan  1  1  1  1  1   w h i c h resulted in a m o r e complete i n t e grated robotic system  was not concerned w i t h the general aspects of robotic design and i m p l e m e n t a t i o n p r i n c i p l e s . perhaps a general d i s b e l i e f in g e n e r a l i t y a r o s e d u r i n g the post-gps  1  era in a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e   but it is c o m i n g to an end as is evidenced in some recent publications   e . g .   1 . but w i t h a l l the e x i s t i n g r e c o r d s in r o b o t i c s study  l i t t l e of the a v a i l a b l e i n f o r m a t i o n on i n t e g r a t i o n is useful  p a r t i c u l a r l y w i t h respect to the design of a robotic s y s t e m or the p r i n c i p l e s o f its i m p l e m e n t a t i o n . 
t h i s w o r k is supported by the jet p r o p u l s i o n l a b o r a t o r y   c o n t r a c t no. 1  and by the n a t i o n a l a e r o n a u t i c s and space a d m i n i s t r a t i o n   nasa g r a n t n o . n g r - 1 - 1 1 - 1 1 . 
     in searching for a m o d e l and i m p l e m e n t a t i o n guidelines  the j p l / c a l t e c h w o r k in r o b o t i c s has also looked for a solution for a basic p r a g m a t i c c o n f l i c t that exists in r o b o t i c s . w h i l e the 
r e s e a r c h task is anticipated to be a long one  it is also expected to y i e l d some useful and p r a c t i c a l results in the near future. the j p l / c a l t e c h project  w h i c h is concentrating on the study of a robotic s y s t e m for planetary e x p l o r a t i o n   a t t e m p t s 
to p r o v i d e v a r i o u s generations of r o b o t i c systems that could be used in the near f u t u r e . 
     in what f o l l o w s   the two s y s t e m aspects of robotics are discussed  i. e.   design and i m p l e m e n t a t i o n . design m u s t be based on a w e l l s t r u c t u r e d m o d e l for a robotic s y s t e m that w i l l define a l l the necessary functions and t h e i r r e l a t i o n s h i p s . i m p l e m e n t a t i o n m u s t be b ro u gh t under c o n s i d e r a t i o n in o r d e r to f u r t h e r emphasize the p r a g m a t i c s of the w o r k . it m u s t i m p o s e on the design a strategy that takes into account both p r i o r i t i e s and p r a c t i c a l aspects. thus  by c o m b i n i n g design and i m p l e m e n t a t i o n   we a r r i v e at a solution that  on the one hand defines subsystem functions and t h e i r d y n a m i c r e l a t i o n s h i p s   and on the other takes into c o n s i d e r a t i o n the r e l a t i v e 
     d i f f i c u l t y of subsystem development. the c o m b i n a t i o n also guarantees an i m p l e m e n t a t i o n process w i t h i n t e r m e d i a t e systems o f p r a c t i c a l use. 
     a p a r a l l e l exists between our approach and that of s t r u c t u r e d p r o g r a m m i n g  1  1 . 	a t o p down approach w i t h a stepwise r e f i n e m e n t - d i s c i plined by the i n t r o d u c t i o n of s t r u c t u r e and the use of w e l l defined elements - p r o v i d e s c l a r i t y and the a b i l i t y to v e r i f y the c o r r e c t n e s s of the i m p l e m e n t a t i o n . 	but  	at the same t i m e   	some a t t r a c tive c o n s t r u c t s are s a c r i f i c e d because the behavi o r r e s u l t i n g f r o m them i s not w e l l defined. 
     the p r i n c i p l e s discussed in this r e p o r t have been used as guidelines for the functional i n t e g r a tion of a robot for planetary e x p l o r a t i o n that is now under study at the jet p r o p u l s i o n l a b o r a t o r y and the c a l i f o r n i a institute of technology  1 . 
t a s k / e n v i r o n m e n t specifications 
     robotic systems m u s t not be looked on as g e n e r a l - p u r p o s e systems; rather  they are s p e c i a l - p u r p o s e systems whose tasks and e n v i r o n m e n t m u s t be w e l l defined. the u n d e r l y i n g

but is not n e c e s s a r i l y a m u s t .

     hence  it is necessary to specify  along w i t h the t a s k / e n v i r o n m e n t   the functional c o n s t r a i n t s that a r e essential to the usefulness of the m a c h i n e . 
f u n c t i o n a l specification 
     the c o m p l e x i t y of the e n v i r o n m e n t and tasks w i l l dictate the functional r e q u i r e m e n t s   w h i c h   in t u r n   specify the type of processes the machine must i n c l u d e . f o l l o w i n g the definitions and notations of ref. 1  our d i s c u s s i o n is r e s t r i c t e d to robotic systems that a r e based on d i g i t a l s y m b o l m a n i p u l a t i o n ; we w i l l f u r t h e r a s s u m e that the t a s k / e n v i r o n m e n t specifications r e q u i r e a r o b o t i c system of the cognitive type  w i t h the g e n e r a l c o n f i g u r a t i o n : 
  o p e r a t i v e   cognitive  conative   
thus  the o p e r a t i v e functions are those that p r o vide i n t e r a c t i o n w i t h the robot w o r l d  e. g.   m a n i p u l a t i o n or sensing . the cognitive functions provide m a n i p u l a t i o n and i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the w o r k m o d e l   such as perception or planning. a n d f i n a l l y   the conative functions are the ones that c o n t r o l the goal sequence and specify the robot a c t i v i t i e s . 
     in the process of functional analysis  it is necessary to identify a l l the operative  cognitive  and conative functions that are r e q u i r e d ; however  it is i m p o r t a n t not to proceed w i t h the i m p l e m e n tation of the processes i n v o l v e d u n t i l the designs have been completed and a strategy of i m p l e m e n tation has been selected. thus  it is the designer's task to proceed w i t h functional a n a l y sis to a l e v e l at w h i c h a l l r e q u i r e d processes have been i d e n t i f i e d and named as functional units; then the m o d u l a r i z a t i o n of the design and its conceptual v e r i f i c a t i o n can be a c c o m p l i s h e d . 
     at the l e v e l of functional analysis  the c o n ceptual c o m p a r i s o n of m a c h i n e functions to those of humans is essential. it affords a better understanding of the r e q u i r e m e n t s and p r o v i d e s for a scheme by which humans w i l l replace some of the r e q u i r e d functions or w i l l c o m p l e m e n t t h e m . but at the same t i m e   both at the higher l e v e l of functional o r g a n i z a t i o n and at the l o w e r l e v e l of functional process i m p l e m e n t a t i o n   the robot designer cannot rely on an understanding 
of the human s y s t e m   as it has l i t t l e to offer to process m e c h a n i z a t i o n or to system i n t e g r a t i o n . 
s t r u c t u r e d design 
     w i t h the specification of e n v i r o n m e n t   	tasks  and functional r e q u i r e m e n t s completed  	s t r u c t u r a l r e q u i r e m e n t s m u s t be specified to assure a w e l l - s t r u c t u r e d design. 	t h i s can be done by 
d e t e r m i n i n g the r e q u i r e m e n t s of a l l functional units  and the i n t e r a c t i o n s a l l o w e d among t h e m . 
     o u r s t r u c t u r e d approach is based on the a s s u m p t i o n that the robot design can be c o m p l e t e l y m o d u l a r i z e d into w e l l - d e f i n e d functional units  w i t h a l i m i t e d i n t e r a c t i o n that a l l o w s a l l the necessary robotic a c t i v i t i e s . 	if such a design existed  	however  	i t m i g h t a r t i f i c i a l l y separate units that seem to be closely r e l a t e d and r e s t r i c t i n t e r a c t i o n s t o s i m p l e f o r m s that a r e w e l l u n d e r stood. 	but at the same t i m e   	it w o u l d i n t r o d u c e c l a r i t y of functional separation and w o u l d ease the robot c o n s t r u c t i o n and the v e r i f i c a t i o n of its 
o p e r a t i o n . 
     in t h i s paper  	we selected the n o n f o r m a l approach. 	the s t r u c t u r e d design is i n t r o d u c e d by the i l l u s t r a t i o n of the m a r s r o v e r design  w h i c h is j p l ' s b r e a d b o a r d for the study of a

i n t e r a c t i o n s and t h e i r functions a r e d e m o n s t r a t e d through a d i s c u s s i o n of the d i f f e r e n t aspects of the design. the basic functional elements chosen for the design are based on the conceptual m o d e l discussed in ref. 1. a m o r e f o r m a l d e f i n i t i o n of the i n t e r a c t i o n s is given in ref. 1  w h i c h describes the c u r r e n t i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of the m a r s r o v e r ' s s t r u c t u r e . 
     the g e n e r a l design is shown in f i g . 1  w h e r e the functional modules  the b o t t o m c i r c l e s   a r e 
     s p e c i f i c a l l y selected for the m a r s r o v e r . each of the three m a j o r subsystems  operative  c o g n i t i v e   and conative i consists of an executive element  a data base  and a battery of functional m o d u l e s . a general robot executive   r e x   interfaces a m o n g the three s u b s y s t e m s . it is the function of r e x to coordinate the o p e r a t i o n of the subsystems and to p r o v i d e the necessary i n t e r a c t i o n w i t h humans. 
     the g e n e r a l s t r u c t u r e has three l e v e l s . on the b o t t o m l e v e l   the functional m o d u l e s are r e p resented by c i r c l e s . the squares in the second 
l e v e l r e p r e s e n t the subsystem's executives. each s u b s y s t e m executive is connected by s o l i d lines to the modules under its c o n t r o l   and to a box that represents its data base. thus  the operative executive m o n i t o r s the m a n i p u l a t i o n   r o v e r m o v e m e n t   and sensor m o d u l e s . its data base concerns machine p a r a m e t e r s that a r e 
relevant to o p e r a t i v e processes. the b r o k e n lines show a d i r e c t c o m m u n i c a t i o n between the modules and other subsystems and indicate that the modules can request i n f o r m a t i o n f r o m other subsystems. this o p e r a t i o n is also under the c o n t r o l of the m o d u l e s executive  and it r e p r e sents one f o r m of i n t e r a c t i o n between the subsystems. the other i n t e r a c t i o n takes place t h r o u g h the top and via r e x   w h i c h r e p r e s e n t s the t h i r d l e v e l . 
     the scheme shows that in such a design for a cognitive robotic system  the robot executive organizes the three subsystems in p a r a l l e l   w h i l e they independently c o n t r o l t h e i r own functional m o d u l e s . while r e x p r o v i d e s one k i n d of subsystem i n t e r a c t i o n and a l l o w s its p a r a l l e l o p e r a t i o n   each of the subsystems independently p r o v i d e s for another subsystem i n t e r a c t i o n through c o n t r o l l e d modules that can again be

operated in parallel. the control structure maintains some hierarchy that provides status control at all times through rex but  at the same time  allows heterarchical interactions between different system elements. 
     it is important to note that a functional unit might integrate many processes and keep its own autonomy. however  all interactions with other modules or other system elements must be controlled by the respective executive. 
     finally  the functional aspects of the design are described below with respect to the developmental process. 
environment versus functional approach 
     once a design has been established  it is possible to begin implementation. however  the difficulties in the implementation of many of the functional modules will make i t a long process. therefore  the building of a robot can take two directions  each representing a different method of simplification. in the f i r s t approach  the focus is on the robot world; in the second  it is on the w o r l d model. in the f i r s t approach  one s i m p l i fies the implementation by simplifying the robot world  and in the second approach  the s i m p l i f i cation focuses on the w o r l d model and its cognitive processes. 
　　　the developmental process which c o r r e sponds to the f i r s t approach is based on the construction of many robotic systems  each suited to operate autonomously in another environment. the environments are simplified to match the state of the art in robotics  and their complexity may grow respectively until it matches some real environment. this approach is in direct contrast to the structured and pragmatic method advocated  and indeed  it has been selected for academic rather than practical reasons  with emphasis on complete autonomy. the robotic work quoted above  1  1  1  contains examples of such an approach. 
     the approach that provides both a smooth development of the robot functions and supports the pragmatic aspects is one which is based on the cognitive aspects. while the robot world is real  its w o r l d model and the related mechanized functions are simplified. but to allow the completion of a complex task  an external support must be introduced. hence  although the actual robot is l i m i t e d in its autonomous behavior  the v i r t u a l robot that relies on external support can s t i l l carry out some important tasks. 
     therefore  the structured approach must be implemented through developmental steps in which the machine is complemented by external support  and machine autonomy is a tradeoff for pragmatics and structural aspects. 
v i r t u a l robot 
     the concept of the virtual robot  1  emphasizes two aspects o  the design - an invariant structure and a functional support. these two aspects provide a solution that isolates the basic robotic system structure from the many subsystem
