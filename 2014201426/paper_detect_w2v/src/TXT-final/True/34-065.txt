a program is d e s c r i b e d which answers q u e s t i o n s about processes- it is assumed t h a t such q u e s t i o n s should be answerable u s i n g as d a t a o n l y p r o cedures f o r p e r f o r m i n g   s i m u l a t i n g   the a c t i o n s . thus  the same procedure t h a t is used to s i m u l a t e the making of a sandwich can be l i s t e d to t e l l   in e n g l i s h   how to make a sandwich or can be examined t o p r e d i c t r e s u l t s and s i d e e f f e c t s such a s t h e

       many q u e s t i o n s ask f o r i n f o r m a t i o n about a c t i o n s or processes. for example  how is a given a c t i o n p e r f o r m e d        why is a substep p e r formed     what would happen if a p a r t i c u l a r a c t i o n 
were p e r f o r m e d       or   is it p o s s i b l e to do such and such   i c a l l such q u e s t i o n s process q u e s t i o n s . a l t h o u g h t h e r e have been many s t u d i e s of q u e s t i o n answering systems  they have been p r i m a r i l y concerned w i t h q u e s t i o n s which can be answered by t a b l e look up or simple d e d u c t i o n . process q u e s t i o n s f r e q u e n t l y cannot be answered by such means. a l t h o u g h it may be f e a s i b l e to a s s o c i a t e   w i t h each a c t i o n   a l i s t o f consumables used i n the e x e c u t i o n o f t h a t a c t i o n i t would n o t b e f e a s i b l e t o m a i n t a i n l i s t s o f a l l p o s s i b l e s i d e e f f e c t s . i n g e n e r a l   t h e problems o f answering process q u e s t i o n s have been l i t t l e e x p l o r e d  but see brown  burton & z d y b e l   1 . 
       to e x p l o r e t h e problems of answering q u e s t i o n s which r e q u i r e a knowledge of processes i have developed a system which knows about k i t c h e n s and c o o k i n g . the system  l u i g i   which was developed w i t h i n the memod computer system at the u n i v e r s i t y of c a l i f o r n i a at san diego  p r o v i d e s an e n g l i s h 
       p a r s e r and data base management f a c i l i t i e s . it was w r i t t e n in the programming language sol*. luigi has two p a r t s : a d a t a base  c a l l e d k i t c h e n w o r l d   which c o n t a i n s i n f o r m a t i o n about o b j e c t s found in a k i t c h e n and a s e t of procedures f o r manip u l a t i n g t h o s e objects*  a set of procedures f o r answering q u e s t i o n s u s i n g t h e data base. 
	luigi can s i m u l a t e 	simple a c t i o n s w i t h i n 
k i t c h e n - w o r l d such as cooking and p r e p a r i n g f o o d s . more i m p o r t a n t   he can examine h i s own procedures f o r p e r f o r m i n g a c t i o n s and c a l c u l a t e o r p r e d i c t the r e s u l t s o f those a c t i o n s * * . t h i s c a p a b i l i t y enables luigi to answer q u e s t i o n s about those a c t i o n s . t h i s approach is analagous to t h e t h e o r y t h a t says persons who engage in an a c t i v i t y are l i k e l y to be the b e s t a u t h o r i t i e s o n t h a t a c t i v i t y . a l t h o u g h luigi i s designed t o o p e r a t e w i t h i n the w o r l d o f

the kitchen  nothing in h i s question-answering a b i l i t i e s depends upon the environment. thus  were luigi moved to some other domain  say that of american history or to a sport such as baseball  once the data base were constructed  containing i n formation about the facts and actions of the new domain  luigi's procedures which are now used to answer questions about the kitchen and about cooking should also apply d i r e c t l y to the new domain. 
preliminaries 
　　　if a program is to be able to examine i t s own procedures meaningfully  it must be aware of the significance of program s t r u c t u r e . as a p r e l i m i nary step  it was necessary to impose r e s t r i c t i o n s on how programs could be defined. in memod a l l actions are encoded as part of a semantic network and are accessible to any sol procedure. however  they are not necessarily in a form that other p r o cedures may r e a d i l y i n t e r p r e t . to help correct t h i s   i have established three classes of a c t i o n s : conscious  semi-conscious and unconscious. 
action classes. conscious actions: conscious actions are those actions that can be broken down i n t o constituent p a r t s   each of which the performer is aware of. for example  the conscious a c t i o n  move x  may be defined to have these p a r t s : 
 1  	
the d e f i n i t i o n of each conscious procedure should contain meaningful subprocedures. that i s   the simulation should be composed of appropriately named simulated subsets. a l i s t i n g of a conscious program should be s i m i l a r to a l i s t of conscious steps done by a human in accomplishing that a c t i o n . an e n g l i s h - l i k e language such as sol  coupled with an inverse parser completes the requirements f o r producing e n g l i s h - l i k e descriptions of actions. s i m i l a r l y   the i n s t r u c t i o n s given to luigi are e n g l i s h - l i k e sets of i n s t r u c t i o n s r e f l e c t i n g the procedure a person would use to accomplish an a c t ion. note that a side effect such as g e t t i n g a spoon d i r t y would never be a conscious act. 
semi-conscious actions: 	semi-conscious actions correspond to the 	lowest levels of conscious a c t ions  	those which humans are barely aware of performing. 	 pick-up  is probably a semi-conscious act. 	humans are conscious of the act of p i c k i n g 
up an object. 	but they need not consciously think 
** luigi cannot actually make a sandwich but he can simulate the process. to answer c e r t a i n questions  it w i l l be necessary for luigi to  simulate his s i mulation . for convenience  i r e f e r to luigi as if he could actually make a sandwich and i r e f e r to his  simulations of simulations  simply as  simul a t i o n s   .

about t h e process by which 	they grasp t h e o b j e c t w i t h 	f i n g e r s and thumb. 	the d e f i n i t i o n s of semiconscious a c t i o n s do n o t need to be c l e a r d e s c r i p t i o n s o f substeps o f the a c t i o n s 	  s i n c e b y d e f i n i t i o n 	t h i s 	i s p r o b a b l y 	i m p o s s i b l e     	b u t t h e y must y i e l d the p r o p e r e f f e c t s when e x e c u t e d . 
unconscious a c t i o n s : unconscious a c t i o n s are those t h a t d o n o t p l a y a d i r e c t r o l e i n t h e s i m u l a t i o n o f human performance. these i n c l u d e r o u t i n e s f o r which t h e r e is no o b v i o u s human a n a l o g u e   but which must be done by the program in o r d e r to p e r f o r m the s i m u l a t i o n  bookkeeping  p r i n t i n g   e t c .   
       semi-conscious a c t i o n s may n o t e n t a i l consc i o u s a c t i o n s and unconscious a c t i o n s may e n t a i l n e i t h e r conscious nor semi-conscious a c t i o n s . i n the d e f i n i t i o n s o f p r o c e d u r e s   conscious a c t i o n s should c o n t a i n as few e x p l i c i t unconscious a c t i o n s as p o s s i b l e . these should be p l a c e d in the s e m i conscious a c t i o n s i f p o s s i b l e . the i n t e n t i s t h a t a semi-conscious a c t i o n w i l l correspond to a s o r t o f p r i m i t i v e a c t i o n f o r people and t h a t unconsc i o u s a c t i o n s w i l l b e i n v i s i b l e t o some o f the systems p r o c e s s i n g r o u t i n e s . f o l l o w i n g these c r i t e r i a   the d e f i n i t i o n o f a conscious a c t i o n b e comes the o r d e r e d l i s t of conscious and semiconscious a c t i o n s   r e s e m b l i n g t h e l i s t o f i n s t r u c t i o n s a human might be asked to f o l l o w . 
p e r s p e c t i v e . a procedure is a set of d i r e c t i o n s f o r p e r f o r m i n g a t a s k . but to the q u e s t i o n answeri n g r o u t i n e s   i t becomes a n o u t l i n e o f the e f f e c t s

 how do y o u   q u e s t i o n s . to see how luigi answers q u e s t i o n s l i k e

place a slice of bread on the counter. 
spread preferred-spread of x on the bread. 
place each ingredient of x on the bread. 
place a second piece of bread on the bread. 
now  when luigi is asked q u e s t i o n  1    he must f i r s t determine t h e form of t h e sandwich   ham and cheese  i n t h i s c a s e     and then t r a c e t h r o u g h the s t e p s o f  g   s u b s t i t u t i n g the a p p r o p r i a t e form o f t h e s a n d wich f o r the v a r i a b l e x  and r e c o n s t r u c t i n g each conscious o r semi-conscious a c t i o n . i n t h i s case the o u t p u t would be:

	i 	spread mustard on the bread. 
	i 	place ham on the bread. 
	i 	place cheese on the bread. 
	i 	place lettuce on the bread.

       to produce t h i s o u t p u t   a procedure c a l l e d trace f i n d s each conscious or s e m i - c o n s c i o u s subact in the proper sequence. trace is capable of r e -

       there is some evidence t h a t people a c t u a l l y go through a process something l i k e t h i s when t h e y answer q u e s t i o n s . many persons have t o l d me t h a t

       there a r e two major c o n t r o l programs in l u i g i : the a d j e c t i v e c o m p i l e r   d e s c r i b e d i n scragg '1  which c o n t r o l s the a n a l y s i s of noun phrases and the comprehender. 
the comprehender. once t h e p a r s e r b e l i e v e s it has s u c c e s s f u l l y parsed t h e s e n t e n c e   the comprehender becomes r e s p o n s i b l e for t h e r e m a i n i n g p r o c e s s i n g o f t h e sentence. i t i s the job o f the comprehender t o a c t u a l l y c a l l t h e q u e s t i o n answering r o u t i n e s . sometimes t h e comprehender can modify t h e s t r u c t u r e c r e a t e d by t h e p a r s e r . for example  when p r o c e s s i n g t h e q u e s t i o n  1  how do you make a tuna sandwich  
the comprehender notes t h a t make belongs to a s p e c i a l c l a s s o f a c t i o n s which r e f e r t o o t h e r a c t i o n s . make x is d e f i n e d as 
 1  	follow the recipe for x. 
the comprehender must f i n d the r e c i p e f o r sandwich and r e p l a c e the o b j e c t of how  hake  by the r e c i p e . now e x e c u t i o n of how w i l l p r o v i d e a l i s t of t h e 
r e c i p e r a t h e r than a l i s t of the make r o u t i n e . the comprehender can a l s o r e f u s e to run the program generated by the p a r s e r . it sometimes does t h i s when the i n p u t is a d e c l a r a t i v e sentence. there are sometimes more than one procedure f o r f i n d i n g the answer to a given q u e s t i o n  such as  why  q u e s t i o n s   . i t i s the comprehender's d u t y t o s e l e c t the answering procedure and a t t e m p t a second c h o i c e i f t h e f i r s t f a i l s . 
       here 	is an example of how t h e comprehender might proceed 	in a t t e m p t i n g to answer 	the q u e s t i o n

	 the cheese  	is r e c o g n i z e d as a p a r t i c u l a r 
e n t i t y i n t h e w o r l d . the comprehender decides t h a t s i n c e cheese has a p r e f e r r e d l o c a t i o n i n t h e r e f r i g e r a t o r   the a c t u a l search should begin t h e r e . the h e u r i s t i c f o r p h y s i c a l s e a r c h i n g i s c a l l e d t o l o o k i n the r e f r i g e r a t o r f o r the cheese. suppose i t f a i l s t o f i n d any. the comprehender then g e n e r a t e s the q u e s t i o n :  did anyone move the cheese   but suppose the event c h e c k i n g r o u t i n e f i n d s no r e f e rences t o cheese; t h e event a n a l y z i n g r o u t i n e i s then c a l l e d . suppose i t d i s c o v e r s t h a t b i l l made welsh r a r e b i t . i n a n a l y z i n g the p r o c e d u r e f o r r a r e b i t   i t d i s c o v e r s t h a t cheese i s used. the r o u t i n e then concludes t h a t t h e r e i s n o cheese  s i n c e i t cannot b e found  and b i l l p r o b a b l y used i t u p   . t h i s may be t h e wrong answer but if s o   it is a t y p i c a l l y human e r r o r . n o t i c e t h a t the d i s c o v e r y i t s e l f p r o v i d e s the reason f o r a n s w e r i n g . thus i n the above example  not o n l y can it be d e t e r m i n e d t h a t t h e r e is no cheese but also t h a t it was used by b i l l . so t h e answer can be r e t u r n e d .

summary 
　　　a method was presented for answering questions about processes. the method  implemented in the luigi system  consists of examination of the system's own simulation procedures. by simply desc r i b i n g his own procedures  luigi can answer  how  questions.  did  who  what  where  when  and  why  questions are answered by  perhaps recursively  examining these descriptions of actions. the system can generate i t s own questions of some of these forms and can also simulate those actions about which it can answer questions. 
appendix 
　　　this appendix contains actual dialogue with the luigi system and two recipes an they were input to luigi. the recipes appear in upper case. the f i r s t l i n e of each defines it as a recipe. the second is the d e f i n i t i o n frame i n d i c a t i n g an agent  sub  and an object x which is the item to be made. 
the subject of this derived token is   i     obtained from the subject  you  of the question by a con-
versational pronoun transformation. the object of *1 is *1  the operator that was previously executed. the printname  bread  of the value returned by the operator is used as the object of the new token. the name counter replaces the p a r t i -
1 the body of the recipe follows. the dialogue was a c t u a l l y performed during several sessions  but was edited to appear here as one conversation. human input is in upper and lower case  preceded by      . computer output is in a l l upper case. items in t h i s type face are comments added l a t e r . 

  don made t o a s t   
  
  
  j u l i e toasted the bread. 
  
  how do you make t o a s t   
if it were the case that i make toast then i must do the following: 
i put toast in toaster i wait until done 
i 	pick-up toast 
i put toast on plate 
i spread butter on toast 
  
  how do you t o a s t r o l l s   
if it were the case that i toast rolls then i must do the following: 
i put roll in toaster 
i wait until done 
i pick-up toast 
i put toast cn plate 
i spread butter on toast 
  
  which pans do you use if you make s p a g h e t t i   i use pan as follows: frying-pan pot 
  how many u t e n s i l s would i use if 	i made a ham omelet  
i know of 1 
  
  how do you make a ham and cheese omelet  if it were the case that i make omelet then i must do the following: 
i 	break egg in bowl 
i 	add milk to egg 
i 	mix egg 
i place frying-pan on stove i pour egg in pan 
i 	fry egg until solidified 
i 	add ham 
i add cheese 
i 	add onion 
i 	fold egg 
  
  how do you make smores  
if it were the case that i make smore then 1 must 
do the following: 
i place foil on counter 
i place graham cracker cn foil 
i put marshmallow on graham-cracker 
i put milk-chocolate on marshmallow 
i broil smore until brown 
  
  make a smore. 
i will now follow the directions. 
let me see where the foil is 
perhaps it is at the drawer yes  it is there. 
let me see where the graham-cracker is 
perhaps it is at the shelves 
yes  	it is there

luigi accepts these as s t a t e m e n t s o f f a c t and adds the s t a t e d i n f o r mation t o h i s d a t a base. 
here luigi examines h i s r e c i p e f o r t o a s t   t r a n s l a t i n g t h e r e c i p e i n t o e n g l i s h w i t h t h e a p p r o p r i a t e changes i n v a r i a b l e s . 
luigi 	searches 	t h e s p a g h e t t i r e c i p e . 	he d i s c o v e r e d f r y i n g pan 	i n t h e d e f i n i t i o n o f 	f r y  which was necessary to brown t h e m e a t   . 	pot was 	in the d e f i n i t i o n 	o f 	b o i l . 
these would be a f o r k f o r m i x i n g and a s p a t u l a f o r f o l d i n g . 

let me see where the marshmallow is 
perhaps it is at the pantry yes  it is there. 
let me see where the milk-chocolate is 
perhaps it is at the refrigerator yes  	it is there.

hmm  let's see. 
don make omelet 
would that do it  
yes 
  
  j u l i e toasted bread. 
  
  who used the k n i f e   
let me think. who's done what  
hmm. let's see. julie toast bread would that do it  
yes 
it was julie 
  
  why d i d j u l i e use the k n i f e   
when did she do that  
let me check. julie toast bread was that when  
yes 
julie spread butter on toast 
  
  why did j u l i e spread b u t t e r on toast  
when did she do that  let me check 
julie toast bread was that when  yes 
julie toast bread 
  
  
  why d i d j u l i e toast bread  
when did she do that  
let me check. julie toast bread was that when  
yes 
because she felt like i t . 
  
  d i d j u l i e 	t o a s t 	r o l l s   
hmm. let's see. julie toast bread would that do  
no but 
julie toast bread 
no. 
i do not know. 
  
  what u t e n s i l s does don use when he makes smores  
don use utensil as follows: 
i don't know of any. 
  
  what vegetables do you add to the sauce when you make spaghetti  
i add vegetable to sauce as follows:

the p a r t i c u l a r act was searched for in the recipe for omelet. 
the recent h i s t o r y is searched for an act of k n i f e using. each event in the recent h i s t o r y is checked to see if the use of a k n i f e constitutes a subpart 
the event involving the use is returned as the answer. 
there is no event which had toasting as a subpart. 
toasting r o l l s is a near miss the s i m i l a r event is noted.
