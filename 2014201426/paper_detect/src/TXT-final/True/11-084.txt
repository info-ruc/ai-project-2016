  	learning and inference 
     j. pitrat has realized a program  which learns to play chess. one of the main problems in chess is to choose what moves are to be considered. the program learns to generate a set of plans for any position from games which are given to it as data. it tries to understand why a move has been successful. if it understands  it generalizes the characteristics which are necessary for the success. the program has learned effectively to find plans  but as it had difficulties to use 
these plans  a program was written  which does not learn  but uses plans efficiently. 
     c. lemaitre  wrote a program simulating a robot learning to structure its world. in a complex world  a robot with a small memory learned to recognize remarkable places and to connect them. so  when it decided to go somewhere  it could move there quickly. a man learning to move in an unknown town has a similar problem to solve. 
     c. roche's program  learned to create operators useful for solving pattern recognition problems. for instance  it received patterns which belonged to one of two sets: in one set  two points are close and in the other the two point are distant. i n i t i a l l y   it received the arithmetic operators: plus  times etc. it was able to find the euclidean distance for separating the patterns in the two given sets. 
     1. carriere  wrote a program which solves psychological tests used for measuring i n t e l l i gence. tests such as sequences of numbers  letters  dominoes to complete  matrices with an empty square  and others were solved. the f i r s t step is to find the relation between the elements 
of the known sequence for inferring the missing element. invited pane1:pitrat & sandewall 

     m. jouannaud  studied the automatic inference of lisp functions from a f i n i t e number of examples. the program can often infer a recursive function from one example. if it can't  it asks for new examples and builds it by steps. with treuil and guiho  he also wrote a program learning some arithmetic laws. 
     m. kodratoff extended sommer's results and wants to implement them in a program. specificall y   he increases the number of recurrence relations and proves the existence of the function when the primitive recursive relations are more 
complex. 
b. 	theorem proving 
     1 theses  1 1 1 1  1  were made in this area and others are on the way. t w i l l not present a l l these works  but only give the general idea which guide them. 1 do not believe that theorem proving is an efficient method for synthesizing programs  understanding natural language or solving robot problems. so  the goal of these theorem proving programs was only to prove mathematical theorems. mathematics w i l l probably be one of the f i r s t areas where programs w i l l be as good as humans. but it is necessary to examine how the mathematician is working. in some areas  there are generally few choices for a human being in a given situation. only one or two possib i l i t i e s are a p r i o r i worthwhile. but there is a great variety of situations. m vivet is studying how a program can use a set of methods for solving mathematical problems. 
another idea is to use a graph for helping the program. some part of the fomula may be coded in the graph. for instance d. pastre  replaces relations by arcs of a graph. the rules modify the formulas and the graph. many steps become obvious when we consider the graph. the formulas are shorter. 
another use of a graph is to have a convenient storage. m. buthion  wrote a program solving compass and straight edge construction problems in plane geometry. unlike gelernter's system  the diagram is not used for verifying whether a property is true. but the diagram stores certain facts e.g. that some points are on the same l i n e   or on the same circle. 
we think that it is important to study the mathematician. once  as we were interviewing  a mathematician said that he never used the usual notation for his theory  except when he was reading or publishing a paper. he himself worked with a representation which was not very clear  but ent i r e l y different from those used in the books. in such cases  a program now solves problems completely differently from how the mathematician does i t . it is then normal that the program's perfor-
mance is not so good  and an interesting problem is to study the representations really used by the mathematician  not when he is publishing  but when he is proving theorems. 
c. 	applications to computer science. 
     a f i r s t approach is the realization of pro-grams which process programs which for various reasons have already been written. pitrat wrote for instance a general game playing program . the rules of a specific game were given as two separate programs written in a special language: one of them generated legal moves  and the other checked whether a given position was a winning one for either player. if the general program is to play well  it must be able to analyze the rules of a game for extracting useful information  particularly what conditions are necessary if a move is to be legal. 
     b falvigny  wrote a program for finding anomalies in a program; an example of an anomaly is the existence of an instruction such that  if it is executed  the program loops indefinitely. an anomaly is not always an error  but it indicates that  somewhere in the program  something is probably not correct. 
     a. adam and j.p. laurent  are writing a program to correct a student's program. this program finds which instructions are false and which instructions could be placed instead. for this  it compares the statement of the problem with the program given by the student. 
another application is program synthesis. usually  we try to define the problem in a descriptive language. for instance the program of a. adam  generates programs which check whether a graph has some property; the program of p. gloess  generates programs translating a formula written in some notation to the equivalent formula written in another notation. in that case  the program receives the formal definition of both notations. f. garijo's program  generates a program computing a function defined by a set of formulas. m. masson's program  1k  generates programs checking whether a tree has a given property. 
     j.l  lauriere's program  receives as data the descriptive statement of a combinatorial problem  with or without optimization . the data of a particular problem is given with the statement. the program f i r s t finds a solution  then  if optimization is needed  it finds the optimal solution and proves that this solution is optimal. 


1 

the method used by the prograu changes with the data. if the data includes oert&in values  the method used by the program works only because of these special values. for practical problems  i t s results were sometimes as good as those of programs which were written for this particular problem. 
d. 	understanding natural language 
     we want to understand how a program can understand. one method for finding this is to write a program understanding a btory  then answering questions on this story. g. sabah  and c. loyo varela  give the program a story in french. the program's goal is to find the motivation of the individuals who acts in this story. it uses pragmatic rules to find their motives. 
other programs answer questions in french on a blocks world  f. rousselot    in spanish on the same domain  m.f. verdejo    in arabic on the constitution of lebanon  b. wakim . 
another method for the same goal is to write a program solving problems given in a natural language: electricity exercises in french  m. rousseau   or mechanics exercises in arabic m. gheith . the last method is to write a program which paraphrases. pitrat is writing such a program for the french language: annotations of chess games. 
we are mainly interested in the representation of the meaning of the sentences and to find what ir formation is necessary for understanding. pragmatics have a great importance in our approach  but it is necessary to give the program a huge amount of information. 
working in another direction  but independently  d. coulon and d. kayser  have written a program learning to identify answers to a given question expressed in a natural language. from a sample of such questions  the program builds rules  and with these rules  it can classify the new answers. the rules are built using some elementary operators. this program is aseful for teaching machines. 
germany  federal republic of 
for quite some years there has been research in germany in areas which are usually considered part of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence; but it was not until 1 that the scientists working in these areas came together to identify themselves as a group with common scientific interests. since then quite a bit has achieved. 
- the group o f f i c i a l l y became a special interest group   fachgruppe   of the german association for informatics  gesellschaft fur informatik - gi  and  like other areas in informatics  it is represented within the gi by a committee   fachausschuss   whose members are scientists working in the f i e l d of a . i . and of pattern recognition. 
those from a . i . are w. bibel  j. laubbch  h.-h. nagel  chairman   and g. veenker. 
- a german a.i.-newsletter with similar intentions like the sigart- or aisb-newsletter now appears regularly on a quarterly basis and is sent to about 1 addresses  currently edited by w. bibel . 
¡¡¡¡in this relatively short time of somewhat more than two years five meetings or workshops exclusively devoted to a.i.-research have been organized  not counting contributions to national conferences with a.i.-sections. 
- an international conference on a . i . w i l l take place in the third week of july 1 in hamburg organized by the gi in co-operation with the society for the study of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence ana simulation of behaviour  aisb  from britain. local arrangements w i l l be the responsibility of h.-h. nagel from hamburg. dr. derek sleeman from the computer based learning project  university of leeds w i l l act as program chairman. 
according to that relatively short history it is not surprising that there is no real center of a.i.-research nor any really big a.i.-project in germany. the activities are scattered over many places  with some clustering taking place at the universities of hamburg and karlsruhe. 
the scientific activities mainly concentrate on two areas of research: processing of naturally represented information  vritten natural language and vision  and automatic deduction. the common future perspectives for both are probably knowledgeable  human oriented programming systems. in the following we subdivide these areas and l i s t names of people working in the respective subareas and their a f f i l i a t i o n  which is normally  institut fur informatik  universitat  name of city    if not stated otherwise . this l i s t is based on the necessarily incomplete information which is at the authors' disposal and therefore cannot be exhaustive.

the group in uppsala was formed by a few people who had worked on typical a . i . problems such as data-base structures for question-answering systems  heuristic search  and high-level languages. however  in specifying the area of research for the new group  we chose to invent the term  technology for  small data bases  rather than a r t i f i cial intelligence. 
in practice   small data bases  has a considerable overlap with a r t i f i c i a l intelligence. the data base of a q.a. system is a typical small data base. in general  small data base technology is concerned with data bases where the conceptual complexi t y of the data and/or the operations that are to be performed on them are the major problems  in contradistinction to conventional data bases where the complexity of information is small  and the volume of data and economy of operation are the dominating problems. lisp-like languages  and very-high-level languages based on lisp  are software tools for small data bases. natural language would probably for many purposes be an ideal means of communication with a small data base. the term small data bases is perhaps equivalent to  knowledge-based systems  that is now often used i n ternationally. 
the significant difference between  small data bases  and   a r t i f i c i a l intelligence  is that the former term implies a stronger emphasis on soft-
ware tools  such as programming languages  and on applications  and that it avoids the sciencef i c t i o n - l i k e overtones which have been both an attraction and a detriment for a . i . in general  
we believe that our term has been useful. however  it could clearly not be used in a country where  big  is a positively loaded word  and  small  is negatively loaded. 
the following are some of the major projects that have been concluded or nearly concluded in these groups: 
- implementation of an interlisp system for ibm 
1 and 1 series computers  jaak urmi et a l   uppsala  
- design of special hardware for a lisp system 
 jaak urmi  linkoeping  
- work on data bases for natural language understanding system  based on the idea chat predicate calculus or an extension thereof should be used as a specification language for both the data base and the storage and retrieval operations. predicate calculus was not used for the representation of the nl informaoion  but rather as the notation wherein the representation of various semantic constructs was expressed. in a sense it was used as a programming language  although one which was not directly implemented  but instead one which served as the abstract program from which a concrete program in a concrete programming language  such as lisp  was written. 
 erik sandewall  uppsala  
- work on comprehension of natural language texts that describe processes  through implementation of a system which accepts descriptions of patience  solitaire  games in natural swedish  analyzes the text  and performs the game. the system has been designed for real natural language texts  taken from books from a bookstore  rather than for constructed examples. the domain is interesting because the games are processes that involve conditional branches as well as loops. since each game description is really an algorithm  the sublanguage used in describing games can be viewed as a natural programming language. the work therefore has a potential interst for other branches of computer science as well. 
 mats cedvall  uppsala  
- implementation of a compiler for atn grammars. this work was done in the early stages of the patience game project  as a development of tools  achieved speed-up with a factor of ten in the ibm 1 interlisp. 
 mats cedvall  uppsala  
the following projects are less directly related to a r t i f i c i a l intelligence  but are natural consequences of the .smal1  data  t a:;e  profile: 
- work on partial evaluation as a programdevelopmenu technique. this work has been done iteratively by designing a partial evaluator  using it for a number of applications  and revising the partial evaluator. the recent version of the system has been able to successfully parti ally-evaluate lisp code that had been written by an expert lisp programmer without previous knowledge that his program was going to be used in the experiment. 
 anders haraldsson and others  uppsala and linkoeping  
compiler for partial evaluator. in conjunction with the work on partial evaluation  there has been work on a partial-evaluator-compiler  which transforms a general-purpose program to a corresponding program generator  and on methods for proving that a proposed use of these programs is correct. 
 erik sandewall and others  uppsala  
a method for formal definition of the semantics of programming languages  demonstrated through a definition of simula. the definition is an idealized compiler  and is significant because it is both effe¡êtrve   i t exists as a lisp program  and has been used to compile and run a systematically designed test batch of simula

programs  which is significant for debugging the definition   and legible  the report describes how a number of real questions about simula semantics are answered by referring to the formal definition . 
 mats nordstrom  uppsala  
an auxiliary system for design of man-machine dialogues. the system represents the dialogue as a network  where each node represents an interaction  and is associated with a typeout from the system  a syntax for possible user responses  indications for which node to go to next  etc. the system  called idecs  contains an interpreter for the network with advanced f a c i l i t i e s such as backtracking and undoing; an interactive editor on the network  and of course f a c i l i t i e s for entry and presentation of the conversation network. the system was designed in response to a practical need  and enables one to let an end user try his hand at the proposed dialogues  find out what details have to be changed  make the change at the spot  and let the final user try again. this system was developed in a cooperation project with the swedish bureau of statistics and has been used in several application projects.  sture hagglund and others  uppsala and linkoeping  
a l l of the last three projects relied very heavily on the use of lisp as an implementation language  and probably could not have been completed if a conventional language had been used. they indicate that interactive programming technology in lisp is a significant spin-off result of a . i . research. 
the projects that have been described represent a sample which characterizes the profile of the activities. a few additional projects should also have been described but have had to be omitted because of space restrictions. 
stockholm university. sten-ake tarnlund and a few co-workers have worked since around 1 with resolution theorem-proving. after i n i t i a l work on implementation and experimental use of a theoremprover on a mini-computer  the group has recently worked in the area of  using predicate calculus as a programming language . this work has included the implementation of several well-known algorithms in this language  an analysis of the properties of the language  and correctness proofs of algorithms expressed in the language. 
research institute of national. defense  stockholm. a group headed by jacob palme undertook a project in the period 1 to implement a f a i r l y e f f i cient question-answering system for a simplified and somewhat un-natural english. the project resulted in a general-purpose parser system and a  semantic net  type data base that was quite sophisticated considering its efficient implementation  in pl/1 . there was also an experimental implementation with esperanto as the input language. 
the projects that have been described so far have been performed in a computer science environment. there are also a number of projects which were performed in other milieus. in 1 a common i n terest group comprising people of these different backgrounds was formed. 
stockholm university  department of linguistics. 
carl-wilhelm welin has studied the problem of  understanding  natural swedish through implementation of a system which accepts weather bullet i n s . these bulletins  published from the central weather bureau  are in sweden customarily written 
in a sublanguage  which contains a large number of stereotypes and which at least i n i t i a l l y appears to be sufficiently limited to be idea  as a test environment for a system endowed with nont r i v i a l understanding. 
stockholm university  department of psychology. anders eriksson has done work on problem solving methods in the context of the 1-game  reduced 1game  protocols of human subjects solving 1puzzles were collected  and used as the basis for a model of problem-solving. the derived model uses production schemas and has a gps-like flavor. the work was presented as a thesis. additional a . i . oriented projects have been started at the department . 
uppsala university  computing center. anna-lena sagvall ilein directs the development of tools for natural language processing  oriented mostly towards the needs of the language departments of the university and the computing center's speciality  
medical data processing. a system for morphological analysis of russian was the f i r s t project  and has been operational since 1. a current project with a distinct a . i . flavor is an experimental system for understanding authentic medical reports on medial column fractures in the hip  written in swedish. the system translates each sentence into a domain-specific internal representation. work on detection of conflicts in the knowledge base comes next. - other projects in the group are a chart-analysis parser according to kay  and a system for inflectional analysis of finnish.
