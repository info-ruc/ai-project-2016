 
　　　at the present stage of research in a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e   machines are s t i l l remote from achieving a l e v e l of i n t e l l i g e n c e comparable in complexity to human thought. as computer applications become more s o p h i s t i c a t e d   however  and thus more i n f l u e n t i a l in human a f f a i r s   it becomes increasingly important to understand both the c a p a b i l i t i e s and l i m i t a t i o n s of

forecasting and assessing the ai field 
　　　why bother to make an e f f o r t to predict future developments in ai  on the one hand it hardly seems worth-
while to plan f u r t h e r ahead than ten years. things are changing so r a p i d l y that any attempt to predict cond i t i o n s more than a decade hence are l i k e l y to be s e r i ously wrong in at least several important respects. the combinatorial power of the exponential curve tends to make short-term forecasts overly o p t i m i s t i c while long-term forecasts are observed to be overly pessimist i c . moreover  the unanticipated appearance of saturavion e f f e c t s can r a d i c a l l y a l t e r the basis of a f o r e cast. 
　　　on the other hand  we tend to make decisions pract i c a l l y every day that must reach beyond a decade  	or 
occasionally even a centuryl for example  new buildings are normally designed f o r an occupancy of one hundred years. because computer systems also have the p o t e n t i a l f o r long term e f f e c t s on human l i f e and society  it. is important that the implications of such systems be under-
stood. it is our hope that t h i s study can be useful to those who are given r e s p o n s i b i 1 i t y f o r future-based 
decisions. 
　　　to put. t h i s study i n t o perspective  it is useful to indicate the present and predicted s t a t e of the art in 
computer hardware  and to indicate the a l - l i k e devices that are c u r r e n t l y on the market. it has been recently indicated by foster  1   that before 1 a generalpurpose microcomputer complete with c e n t r a l processor and i n t e r n a l working memory  but no peripherals  w i l l be a v a i l a b l e on a s i n g l e chip in small q u a n t i t i e s for a cost of between $1 and $1. about t h i s time frame  magnetic bubble technology is expected to bring the cost of memory from the present $1 a b i t to $1 a b i t .

	1. 	setting up the study 
　　　in assessing the effects of the a r t i f i c i a l intelligence field on society  we found it convenient to 
break the effort into two parts: 
 1  a technical portion in which the ai field is examined  capabilities derived  and products postulated. 
	1. 	current ai capabilities and derived products 
　　　in order to postulate products that could result from advances in the a r t i f i c i a l intelligence field  we f i r s t partitioned the field into basic subject cate-
gories  and then analyzed the capabilities currently available in each category. the following categories and the capabilities associated with each category were 
used in the study: 
　　　1-language understanding. the ability to  understand  natural language and to respond in natural language. ability to translate from spoken language to a written form. ability to translate from one natural language to another.

the products postulated in t h i s paper d i f f e r most s t r i k i n g l y from conventional computer applications 	in three ways. 	f i r s t   	is the requirement for n a t u r a l com-

any a p p l i c a t i o n intended to provide mass personal access to computing power. second is a problem-solving capab i l i t y so that humans can specify a desired e f f e c t r a t h e r than having to supply a d e t a i l e d procedure f o r obtaining that e f f e c t . t h i r d l y   many of the products require an a b i l i t y to i n t e r a c t d i r e c t l y w i t h t h e i r r e a l - w o r l d environment through sensors that acquire i n formation  and e f f e c t o r s that implement a desired change. 
　　　to e s t a b l i s h the technical f e a s i b i l i t y of the projected products  we compared the levels of competence that could be achieved w i t h current al c a p a b i l i t i e s  table 1  w i t h those required to achieve the stated performance goals. one might conclude from table 1 that a reasonable s t a r t has been made f o r many of the products. it must be pointed out  however  that in the past it has proven very d i f f i c u l t to extrapolate the r e s u l t s of al research. most of the work c i t e d in this table has involved l i m i t e d domains of knowledge  small data bases  and ad hoc techniques. it is unknown at t h i s time how many of the techniques are extendable to   r e a l - l i f e   data bases. 
       i n p r e d i c t i n g future c a p a b i l i t i e s i n the a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e f i e l d   we were faced with the problem  flow do you know that a development in a s u b f i e l d of al represents s i g n i f i c a n t progress   c r i t i c s of the al f i e l d such as dreyfus  1   and fein  1   have doubted the s i g n i f i c a n c e of much of the alleged progress in the f i e l d . in p a r t i c u l a r   dreyfus has used the analogy of a man who  having succeeded in climbing a tree  claims that he has solved part of the problem of going to the 
moon. 
　　　there is no simple r e s o l u t i o n to the problem  and indeed we cannot hope to s e t t l e the question here.   i t may be that it is not possible to evaluate a development u n t i l some years have passed  and one sees the e f f e c t s that the development has produced.  the f o l l o w i n g i n d i c a t o r s of progress were useful in our e v a l u a t i o n :

fundamental problems in achieving the products 
　　　there are two types of d i f f i c u l t y in achieving the al products  the f i r s t concerning present l i m i t a t i o n s of the al f i e l d   and the other concerning the problem of f o r m a l i z i n g areas of human endeavor which do not appear to be amenable to f o r m a l i z a t i o n . these two problem areas are discussed below. 
　　　fundamental problems in ai technology- in examining current c a p a b i l i t i e s in the al product areas  table 1  three main problems appear to be: 
 1  acquiring  representing  s t r u c t u r i n g   and r e t r i e v i n g world knowledge  
 1  a t t a i n i ng g e n e r a l i t y from ad hoc programs  and 
 1  problems 	in perception. 
acquiring  representing  s t r u c t u r i n g   and 
　　　retrieving world knowledge-a c r u c i a l part of many of the ai products is the a b i l i t y to acquire  represent. structure  and r e t r i e v e large amounts of general knowledge about the world  ad hoe knowledge about s p e c i f i c problem domains  and self-knowledge regarding the system's own c a p a b i l i t i e s . the fundamental problem associated with large amounts of information is determining which subsot is relevant to the task at hand. this problem includes the choice of a represonlalion that presents the relevant data at an appropriate level of d e t a i l . the system must also be able to restructure the relevant knowledge so that  it can be e f f i c i e n t l y 
applied to a s p e c i f i c problem. knowledge is t y p i c a l l y acquired in an incremental manner; as new facts are encountered in the performance of tasks  they are i n t e grated-- whenever possible as generalisations of e x i s t i n g information  the system must bo able to determine when 
necessary knowledge i s n ' t a v a i l a b l e   and how it can best be acquired. 
　　　some other outstanding issues include the r e t r i e v a l of knowledge storod in procedural form  the representation of common sense   and the u t i l i z u t i on of plausible inference. 
　　　generality from ad hoc programs-al programs which aspire to great g e n e r a l i t y in a problem domain have most. often exhibited unaeceptably poor performance. consequently  many al workers have adopted the view that i n t e l l i g e n c e is best embodied in the c o l l e c t i v e eftect 
of many ad hoc procedures  	each of which solves a part i c u l a r problem in a l i m i t e d context. 	generality 	is then attained by accumulating a l i b r a r y of such procedures and s e l e c t i n g the most appropriate ones f o r any given s i t u a t i o n . 	this approach is reasonable given the l i m i t e d number of s i t u a t i o n s l i k e l y to arise in the r e -
s t r i c t e d domains of present systems  when such systems f a i l   a human programmer can use his knowledge of the task requirements  the problem domain  and the machine's 
c a p a b i l i t i e s to add a routine appropriate f o r the new s i t u a t i o n . 	thus  one approach to g e n e r a l i t y is to provide a f u t u r e system with s i m i l a r knowledge so that it can emulate t h i s problem-solving function of a human programmer. 	the user of such a system might be able to guide the machine in constructing i t s own programs

capabilities in derived product areas 
achieved  achievable  with current a . i . expertise 
1. 	automated inquiry system 
automatic inquiry systems with inferential reasoning are currently practical for small data bases and for large well structured ones. 	effective searches may require the human user to refine his query interactively. 
1. 	automated intelligence system 
systems have been built that augment intelligence by clustering data  identifying c r i t i c a l factors in multivariant analysis  factor analysis   and by searching for inferential chains that relate two arbitrary facts in a symbolic data base. however  such systems cannot acquire their own knowledge. inputs must be manually filtered for relevance and supplied in an appropriate internal representation. 
1. 	talking typewriter 
a voice typewriter could today provide reliable phonetic transcription for about 1 to 1 arbitrary words if spoken one at a time. 	transcription of continuously flowing speech could be accomplished for the same 
number of words if the discourse were confined to a limited domain for which the machine had adequate semantic knowledge to resolve segmentation ambiguities. 	present pattern classification techniques have proven 
	unable to discriminate more than a few hundred categories. 	 this word limitation could be circumvented by 
the crude expedient of using spelled speech.  
1. 	automatic language translator 
low quality automatic language translation is already commercially used to obtain crude but readable abstracts of foreign technical papers. 	high quality translation that captures a l l intended subtleties requires 
	that the input utterance be f i r s t understood and then reconstituted in the second language. 	such translation 
is thus feasible only in the limited semantic domains which have been successfully handled by existing lan-
guage understanding programs. 
1. 	automatic identification systems 
these systems now suffer from the same pattern classification problems that limit the voice typewriter. it is d i f f i c u l t to build systems that discriminate more than 1 to 1 categories  e.g.  faces  fingerprints  
	voices . 	an interactive system in which humans provide descriptions of important features for a mechanized 
decision maker could perhaps be made practical in the near future. 
1. 	mobile robot 
autonomous real-world robots are not yet feasible  although at least two laboratories are actively pursuing the following goals:  a  a mobile robot that plans and executes tasks requiring polyhedral solids to be 
pushed between otherwise empty rooms  future operation w i l l include a real office environment ;  b  a robot vehicle that can circumnavigate a closed roadway system. 
1. 	machine/animal symbiont 
several research projects are currently attempting to do pattern classifications using inputs obtained from the neurons of animals and even from human eeg signals. a small number of gross patterns can be discrimi-
nated  but the results at present are far too crude for practical use. 
1. 	automatic diagnostician 
many diagnostic techniques have already been successfully automated  including chemical laboratory analyses  cell counting  x-ray and electrocardiogram interpretation  etc. several interactive systems have been built which accept symptoms  test results  and patient history  and return diagnoses or specific requests for more data. progress in this field is limited because a machine cannot yet observe a patient directly and because each application must be programmed from scratch. more fundamental problems exist due to the crude state of current medical knowledge. 
1. 	personal biological model 
many c r i t i c a l biological functions are already automatically monitored in hospital intensive care wards. the problem of making such capabilities available to everyone on a continuing basis is mostly one of economics. 	further work by biologists in modeling the human system is needed to adequately simulate the effects 
of medication. 
1. 	computer psychiatrist 
computerized psychiatry is not yet feasible. after the problem of natural language understanding is solved  attention can then focus on the equally challenging task of representing the semantics and pragmatics of human interpersonal relations.

1. 	a r t i f i c i a l organs 
although the problem of controlling a r t i f i c i a l organs with feedback from the body is currently more in the domain of control systems than a . i .   future implementations may involve a . i   concepts. 	present experimentation with feedback controlled pacemakers and  also  the l i f e support systems in satellites can be viewed as 
f i r s t examples of this promising technique. 
1. 	computer arbiter 
a system has been built that simulates decisions of the supreme court with some degree of success. the computer bases its decisions on precedents of law and biases of the justices disclosed in past decisions. if those biases were replaced by a formalized statement of the principles of justice  one might have the basis 
	for an automatic arbiter. 	however  such formalization has not yet been attempted. 
1. 	industrial robot 
robot manipulators are being used in increasing numbers on automobile assembly lines  to do repetitive tasks like spot welding  which can be preprogrammed and which operate without feedback. the addition of simple  
visual and tactile sensors would significantly broaden the range of application. for example  the general motors research lab successfully demonstrated a system that could mount wheels on a hub  using visual techniques to align the wheel with the studs. 
1. 	voice order-taker 
a voice order-taker  like the voice typewriter  can now be built to handle about 1 items. if the catalog is mare extensive  items would have tn be specified by giving code numbers. limited voice response by such 
a system  using combinations of prestored words and phrases  is now available. 
1. 	insightful weather; insightful economic model 
1. 
predicting weather or economic activity is s t i l l as much an art as a science. the main problem with automating such activities is that the experts themselves have yet to agree on the most important decision criteria or even on the most relevant input parameters. it is perhaps more feasible to simulate a particular expert  
but even hero the expert probably would be unable to express formally the subjective criteria he uses to 
reach decisions. 	the machine is further handicapped in areas like weather analysis  where important inputs are only available in pictorial form  e.g.  cloud cover photographs . 	in these domains  an interactive sys-
tem could be used  where the machine's decision is based on manually interpreted input data. 
1. 	robot chauffer 
sensors and systems are now available that can augment driving skills  e.g.  collision avoidance radar  antiskid braking computer  etc. . moreover  laboratory vehicles have been made to follow a white line and pro-
grams have been written to detect the edge of a road and to discriminate planar shadows from real obstacles. 
1. 	robot tutor 
the best existing cai systems allow mixed initiative interactions  wherein the student can alter the course of instruction by asking the machine unanticipated questions about this subject area to test his own under- 
	standing. 	researchers are currently planning systems which w i l l ask probing questions to model a student's 
comprehension of a subject area  and then plan a customized tutorial strategy intended to transform the 
	existing conceptual structure into a desired one. 	the success of such research is very dependent on progress 
in natural language understanding and psychological investigations of knowledge representations and learning. 
1. 	universal game player 
many game playing programs have been written in the course of studying heuristic programming and learning. machines can play champion level checkers and dominoes; reasonable chess  b-level   kalah  and scrabble; and poor go. however  each game was individually programmed using heuristics deduced from careful human introspection and representations painfully derived to allow effective utilization of those heuristics. it is s t i l l premature to contemplate a general game player that can be taught to play a new game as one would teach 
a human opponent  or significantly improve its internal representations  and thus performance  as a result 
of playing. 
1. 	general factotum 
general-purpose humanoid-type robots remain  for the time being  in the realm of science fiction. however  u n t i l very recently  no a . i . research has been seriously directed toward this goal. the mobile robot effort described under product 1 could be viewed as a beginning. 
1. 	creation and evaluation system 
the evaluation of human artistic endeavors is perhaps the most subjective of a l l human judgements. 	consequently  the criteria of judgement are among the most d i f f i c u l t to formalize as computer algorithms  except for a few general notions like harmony or color balance. 	perhaps the computer's inability to evaluate its own creative efforts in human terms explains the primitive state of computer-generated art and poetry.  see gip and stiny  l1j for a discussion of aesthetic systems.

f o r example by suggesting promising h e u r i s t i c s   providing necessary knowledge  and evaluating performance on test cases. such an i n t e r a c t i v e problem solver should have a motive-guessing c a p a b i l i t y w i t h which to attempt solutions to incompletely formulated problem requirements. indeed  a large part of the s o l u t i o n to many problems   l i k e most of those a r i s i n g in ai  l i e s in properly formulating the problem. 
　　　perception problems-a number of d i f f i c u l t problems a r i s e in r e a l - w o r l d perception   e . g .   speech  v i s i o n   that f o r the most part have been systematically eliminated from the l i m i t e d domains of present systems. these problems include sensory overload which conceals objects of i n t e r e s t in a torrent of i r r e l e v a n t d e t a i l   the related problem of p a r t i t i o n i n g i n t e r e s t i n g   f i g u r e s   from the general background  forming i n t e r n a l 
　　　representations of complex or amorphous r e a l - w o r l d o b j e c t s   and f i n a l l y matching such descriptions against a large data base of known objects. the foremost problem appears to be in p a r t i t i o n i n g the input i n t o meani n g f u l e n t i t i e s in the context of the current problem. in v i s i o n   objects of i n t e r e s t must be i s o l a t e d from the background. in speech  a continuous waveform must be d i v i d e d i n t o segments corresponding to words. the problem is well known to gestalt psychologists who have observed that the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of parts or features of an object is often determined by the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the whole. thus machines  in proceeding from the parts to a whole can be overwhelmed by the combinatorics of examining every a l t e r n a t i v e i n t e r p r e t a t i o n f o r each p a r t . recently  one of the authors had some success in 
applying dynajnic-prograramitig-tj'pe techniques to reduce the combinatorics of a b r u t e - f o r c e search for the best i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of a scene  according to a model of the 
desired o b j e c t . it may be p r a c t i c a l to use such techniques in a general scene analysis system  to follow up hypotheses r e s u l t i n g from a preliminary organization   f i s c h l e r   1   
       the problem of value formalization-several of the products postulated require that a f o r m a l i z a t i o n of a e s t h e t i c s   mores  e t h i c s   and other judgmental areas be a v a i l a b l e . for example  product 1  the computer a r b i t e r   requires not only the a b i l i t y to understand the s u b t l e t i e s of human emotion * but must also have a v a i l a b l e some c o d i f i c a t i o n of the moral  e t h i c a l   and l e g a l rules of society ao as to be able to give advice  or render a v e r d i c t . the creation and valuation system. product 1 . requires a formalism which somehow expresses man's concepts of excellence in the a r t s . 
　　　there is l i t t l e to report in the way of progress in these areas. aside from some work in music by computer  von foerster and beachamp  1   some elementary attempts at computer poetry and prose  and some 
rough analysis of court decisions  there is l i t t l e hope  or danger  depending on one's point of view  that the problem of f o r m a l i z i n g such areas of human endeavor 
w i l l be solved in the near term. 
       even if such f o r m a l i z a t i o n could be made  society would be faced w i t h the embarrassing problem of r e v e a l i n g the inconsistencies inherent in any organization of 
either via n a t u r a l language or by means of sensors  such as a   l i e detector  s o r t of device. 
of human beings. we know that there are many s i t u a t i o n s in which some people are considered  more equal  than 
others. for example  white c o l l a r fraud i n v o l v i n g t h e f t from a company is frequently d e a l t w i t h less severely than blue c o l l a r t h e f t from the same company. appearances and a t t i t u d e s often a f f e c t judgments  as do family connections or personal acquaintances. although the adversely affected segment of the pbulic seems to be w i l l i n g to t o l e r a t e such i n e q u i t i e s   due to ignorance  lack of power  or i n d i f f e r e n c e   one doubts whether the same passive behavior would occur if an attempt was made to incorporate e x p l i c i t l y the present defects of society i n t o an automated a r b i t r a t i o n system. a c o n f l i c t would

	1. 	societal implications 
　　　decisions concerning the rate of technological development  time of appearance of a product  and the s o c i e t a l implications are judgmental in nature  and f o r this p o r t i o n of the study we used the delphi technique  
a method f o r systematically s o l i c i t i n g and c o l l a t i n g informed judgments on a p a r t i c u l a r t o p i c . 	under t h i s procedure  	p a r t i c i p a n t s respond to a series of questionnaires interspersed with summaries of the responses by group members to e a r l i e r questionnaires. 	the method d i f f e r s from simple p o l l i n g procedures 	in that 	the feedback obtained from the respondents allows the questions to be modified   e . g .   	a question may be too vague   
and tends to prevent  snap-judgments  since the respondent can see how his answer stands with respect to the other p a r t i c i p a n t s . 
　　　as indicated in section 1  we f i r s t p a r t i t i o n e d the products i n t o the s o c i e t a l areas which they most a f f e c t : human information processing  s e c u r i t y   health  law. production and manufacturing  commerce  education  social i n t e r a c t i o n   and a e s t h e t i c s . we then derived applications and implications f o r each product  where an a p p l i c a t i o n is a statement of how the product would be used by society  and an i m p l i c a t i o n is the e f f e c t on society of these a p p l i c a t i o n s . thus  f o r product 1

　　　we used a format s i m i l a r to that of de brigard and helmer  1   as shown in f i g . 1. for each product  we indicated the social impact sector  the applications and i m p l i c a t i o n s   and the ai categories. the information s o l i c i t e d was:

       the questionnaire was sent to members of the i n t e r n a t i o n a l 	joint a r t i f i c i a l 	i n t e l l i g e n c e council and to other experts in the ai f i e l d throughout 	the world. a t o t a l of s i x t y questionnaires was mailed out  	and twenty-one responses were obtained. 	an a d d i t i o n a l 
mailing was sent to the san francisco ieee systems  man  and cybernetics society  and a t o t a l of twenty questionnaires were received. the analysis of results given below is based on two rounds of responses from the f i r s t group; the complete r e s u l t s w i l l be presented in a forthcoming ieee r e p o r t . where i n t e r e s t i n g differences between the two groups occurred  they are also b r i e f l y noted. 
respondents were generally very o p t i m i s t i c concerning technology development. as shown in table 1  t h i r t e e n of the products have 
median dates for prototype product development of 1 or e a r l i e r . in the d e t a i l e d responses  only one product had an upper q u a r t i l e in the  never  range  p1 . it is i n t e r e s t i n g to note  however  that in going from the f i r s t to the second round  there was a very s l i g h t   but noticeable  s h i f t toward conservatism in product dates as well as the expected observation of a reduction in the width of the houses ind i c a t i n g a sharpening of concensus. 
 1  	prototype vs. commercial dates 
for the products having prototype dates of 1 or e a r l i e r there is a f a i r l y systematic t r a n s l a t i o n of 1 1 years as one moves from median prototype to median commercial date. 

results of the delphi study 
       the delphi comments were reviewed manually  while the time estimates and l i k e l i h o o d and d e s i r a b i l i t y of the products were tabulated by a simple computer program. 	these r e s u l t s were presented d i r e c t l y on the questionnaire  as shown in f i g . 1 t o r review by the p a r t i c i p a n t s . 	the l e f t side of the   h o u s e - l i k e   f i g u r e represents 	the lower q u a r t i l e   	the roof peak is the median  	and the r i g h t side is the upper q u a r t i l e . 
　　　general observations on the results-~due to lack of space  the complete 1 page delphi questionnaire 
w i l l not be reproduced here. 	instead an o v e r a l l summary of the delphi responses is given in table 1  	the r e s u l t s were obtained by weighing each response w i t h 
the s e l f - r a n k i n g of expertise supplied by each responj . 
dent for each product. ＊ in the t a b l e   products were f i r s t   grouped according to the median r a t i n g they r e ceived for p o t e n t i a l s i g n i f i c a n c e  high  medium  and low   and w i t h i n these significance groups  they were l i s t e d in order of prototype date  the o v e r a l l des i r a b i l i t y is a rough summary of the responses concerning d e s i r a b i l i t y f o r each product. 
the following r e s u l t s are of i n t e r e s t : 
	 1  	product p o t e n t i a l significance 
half of the ai products were thought to be of high p o t e n t i a l s i g n i f i c a n c e and most of the rest f e l l in the medium p o t e n t i a l s i g n i f i c a n c e 
category. 
note that in asking for judgments concerning time of commercial appearance  we are asking not only whether a product can be made  but also when the commercial forces of need plus p r o f i t a b i l i t y w i l l cause a product to appear on the market.

	 1  	differences between ai council and smc results 
although not u n i v e r s a l l y the case  ai council respondents tended to be s l i g h t l y more o p t i m i s t i c and have a somewhat stronger concensus 
than the smc group  both as far as prototype and commercial development dates  	and the 
l i k e l i h o o d and d e s i r a b i l i t y of the a p p l i c a tions of the products. perhaps t h i s r e f l e c t s the f a c t that many members of the ai council 
are a c t u a l l y engaged in the research themselves and have a vested i n t e r e s t in the r e s u l t s . yet one cannot disregard the c o l l e c t i v e opinion of those experts who are closest to the f i e l d . 
       relation to other studies-there have been many studies concerned with the impact of technology on society  e . g .   the e f f e c t of computers and data banks on p r i v a c y   westin  1  and the e f f e c t s of automation on employment  borodin and gotlieb  1   our study was not designed to quantify the impact of ai products on society; we can only obtain informed opinion concerning the f e a s i b i l i t y of a comprehensive set of ai products and the general nature and spectrum of such impact. thus  it is s i m i l a r in s p i r i t to the delphi study of debrigard and helmer  1  which examined the s o c i e t a l consequences of twenty physical and b i o l o g i c a l 
breakthroughs. 
　　　another study of i n t e r e s t is reported by michie  1   in which 1 experts in a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e from england and the u.s. were queried. two estimates of i n t e r e s t   concerning level of ai a b i l i t y and the impact of ai on industry are reproduced in table 1. the e n t r i e s in the table represent the number of experts who responded to the items for each time estimate. it w i l l be noted that almost a l l of the experts f e l t that computing systems e x h i b i t i n g human i n t e l l i g e n c e are at least twenty years away  and that s i g n i f i c a n t ai indust r i a l s p i n - o f f w i l l occur in less than ten years. 
	1. 	conclusions 
two types of conclusions are given below; 
 1  general s o c i e t a l i m p l i c a t i o n s of the ai products 
 1  the need arises to formalize a l g o r i t h m i c a l l y some of the e t h i c a l and empirical rules and tradeoffs that society observes i m p l i c i t l y   but which are rarely made e x p l i c i t - f o r example  it may be necessary for a robot to have available rules which d i c t a t e how to trade-off l i f e f o r property  e . g .   when i s i t allowable to wreck an automobile to avoid k i l l i n g an animal

societal 	controls 
       in examining some of the implications of the a l oriented products  we noted that some of these products w i l l b r i n g w i t h them questions of safety  privacy  and e t h i c s . 
　　　safety-the safety factors are obvious: is a designer to be allowed to pr duce autonomous devices which are free to navigate over c i t y streets and in homes and o f f i c e s without some review procedure  for devices which require an algorithmic formulation of judgmental f a c t o r s

societal 	implications 
       in examining the s o c i e t a l i m p l i c a t i o n s   we f i n d that the most important possible long-term e f f e c t s of the increasing development and a p p l i c a t i o n of ai tech-
nology are as f o l l o w s : 
 1  a decreased need by most persons for d i r e c t contact or i n t e r a c t i o n w i t h other human 
beings-that i s   it may be possible for i n t e l l i g e n t machines of the f u t u r e to supply not only i n t e l l e c t u a l s t i m u l a t i o n or i n s t r u c t i o n   but also domestic and health care  social conversation  entertainment  companionship  and even physical g r a t i f i c a t i o n . 
　　　ai development has now reached a stage where such questions are no longer in the s c i e n c e - f i c t i o n realm. for example  some of the mobile robots already developed have enough speed and power to cause possible i n j u r y to humans encountered by the robot in the course of performing i t s tasks. any device which includes the chara c t e r i s t i c s of m o b i l i t y   speed  s t r e n g t h   and unpredicta b i l i t y can be extremely hazardous  especially in an uncontrolled environment or where children are present. 
1 　　　privacy-some of the products postulated include the a b i l i t y to i n t e r r e l a t e large and diverse data bases using advanced deductive techniques. proper safeguards must be imposed on the c o l l e c t i o n and use of ouch data base systems to insure that the r i g h t of privacy of the i n d i v i d u a l i s respected. 
　　　ethics problems of ethics arise in automated counseling systems which advise a student concerning career choices. has anyone v e r i f i e d that the counseling program is not biased against c e r t a i n groups  or unaware of the status of c e r t a i n career f i e l d s   another example of an e t h i c a l question arises in eliza-like systems  welzenbaum  1   f o r p s y c h i a t r i c counseling which the u n i n i t i a t e d i n d i v i d u a l assumes has depth and s o p h i s t i c a t i o n   not r e a l i z i n g that the program operates using very l i m i t e d word patterns and phrases. 
　　　somehow  these p o t e n t i a l dangers to society must be communicated to decision makers in both the public and private s e c t o r s . baram  1  has discussed t e c h nology assessment and s o c i a l c o n t r o l   
 it is now time t o . . . d e v e l o p a coherent framework f o r the social c o n t r o l of technology and ensure that forthcoming processes of technology assess-
ment and u t i l i z a t i o n w i l l be systematic and humane.  
　　　perhaps one vehicle f o r keeping the public and decision makers informed about ai devices might be an ai e t h i c a l review board  s i m i l a r to the review boards used in the medical profession  which deal w i t h safety and e t h i c a l problems. members of the board would be selected from the al community  but would also include l e g a l   p o l i t i c a l   and other advisors  as r e q u i r e d . the board would recommend l e g i s l a t i o n   e s t a b l i s h standards  suggest safety guidelines tor the use of robots in h u man environments  and advise i n v e s t i g a t o r s in the al 
f i e l d by means of j o u r n a l n o t i c e s .
