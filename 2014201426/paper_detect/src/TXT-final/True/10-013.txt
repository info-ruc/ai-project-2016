introduction 
in a g l o b a l v i e w   tall-spin is a program that s i m u l a t e s r a t i o n a l behavior by c h a r a c t e r s in the w o r l d . the simulatorhas three a c t i v e components. there is a problem solver t h a t   given a g o a l   p r o duces other goals  subgoals  and a c t u a l e v e n t s . there is an a s s e r t i o n mechanism t h a t takes an event and adds it to  memo r y   : trie s t a t i c d e s c r i p t i o n oi each knowledge a r e a   what the p h y s i c a l world looks l i k e a t t h a t i n s t a n t   what s o c i a l r e l a t i o n s h i p s e x i s t between c h a r a c t e r s at t h a t i n s t a n t   ana so on. f i n a l l y there is an m l e r e n c e mecnanisin t h a t produces trie consequences of an event. when an event is a s s e r t e d   i t s consequences are computed and a s s e r t e d   t n e i r consequences are computed and a s s e r t e d   and so on. one kind ot consequence is a g o a l . goals are a s s e r t e d   not by adding them to memo r y   but rather by c a l l i n g the problem s o l v e r   which completes the c y c l e . this approach t o s t o r y t e l l i n g i s very d i f f e r ent from the work of k l e i n   as r e c e n t l y di scussed   1   . 
sample o u t p u t from tall-spin: 
oncl upon a time george ant lived near 	a 
patch of ground. there was a nest in an ash tree. wilma bird lived in the nest. 
there was some water in a river. wilma knew that the water was in the river. george knew that the water was in the river. one day wllma was very thirsty. wilma wanted to get nlar some wattr. wilna flew from her nest across a meadow through a vallby to the river. wilma drank the water. wllma wamm 't thirsty 
any 	more. 
	glgrgb 	was 	very 	thirsty. 	george 
wanted 	to 	get 	near some water. 	g e u r g e 
walked from his patch of ground across the meadow thkough the valley to a river bank. george fell into the water. gbukge wanted lu get near the valley. george c o u l u n ' l bet near the valley. 
geurge wanted to get near thl mladuw. g l u k g l couldn't get near the i eadgw . wilma wanted george to get near the meadow. wjlma wantld to get near george. wilma grabbed geurge with her claw. wllma touk george from the river through the valllv to the meadow. george was 
devo'led to wllma. george owed everything to wllma. wilma let go of georgb. george fell to the meadow. the end.

walked to the oak tree. 	he ate the 	beehive.  
　　　a further refinement is to unscramble an acceptable answer in the proper fasnion  remembering a l i t t l e better what the original question was. 
　　　a l l tne action used to focus on a single character  other characters could respond to him only in very limited ways  when they were asked direct questions  tor example. there was no concept of  noticing : it people walk into your room  they needn't always announce their presence. you see them. the following story was an attempt to produce  the ant and the dove   one of the aesop fables. 
        1   henry ant was t h i r s t y . he walked over to the river bank where his good friend b i l l bird was s i t t i n g . henry slipped and f e l l in the river. he was unable to call for help. he drowned.  
	that 	wasn t 	supposed 	to 	happen. 
falling into the river was deliberately introduced to cause the central  problem  of the story. had henry been able to call to b i l l for help  b i l l would have saved him  but i had just added a rule that said that being in water prevents speech  which seemed reasonable. since b i l l was not asked a direct question  he d i d n ' t notice his friend drowning in the river. 

a piece of cheese in his mouth. he noticed that he was holding the piece of cheese. he became hungry  and swallowed the cheese. the fox walked over to the crow. the end.  
	that was supposed to have been 	 the 
fox and the crow   of course. the fox was going to t r i c k the crow out of the cheese  but when he got there  there was no cheese  because the crow  noticed  that he had some food in his mouth  from which the program inferred that he'd be hungry.  the f i x was to assert at the beginning that the crow had eaten recently  so that even when he noticed the cheese  he d i d n ' t become hungry.  
　　　　 1   joe bear was hungry. tie asked irving bird where some honey was. irving refused to t e l l him  so joe offered to bring nim a worm if he'd t e l l him where some honey was. irving agreed. but joe d i d n ' t know where any worms were  so he asked i r v i n g   who refused to say. so joe offered to bring him a worm if he'd t e l l him where a worm was. irving agreed. but joe didn't know where any worms were  so he asked i r v i n g   who refused to say. so joe offered to bring him a worm if he'd t e l l him where a worm w a s . . . .   
　　　lesson: don't put a goal on the stack if i t ' s already there. try something else. if there i s n ' t anything else  you can't achieve that goal. 

natural lan*uarc*-1: meghan 
1 　　　here are some more rules. if you're hungry and you see some food  y o u ' l l want to eat i t . if you're trying to get some food and you f a i l   you get sick. if you want some object  try bargaining with the object's owner. innocuous  right  
tnat ne was also in a position of dominance over himself  so he refused to give himself the cheese. he couldn't think of a good reason why he should give himself the cheese   i f he did that  he'd lose the cheese    so he offered to bring himself a worm if he'd give himself the cheese. that sounded okay  but he didn't know where any worms were. so he said to himself  'henry  do you know where any worms are ' but of course  he d i d n ' t   so he . . . .  and so on   
　　　　　what does tale-spin know  tale-spin is a problem solver  top-down and goal-directed. its output may be regarded as a trace through problemsolving procedures. problems are associated with a particular area of knowledge  or what i c a l l a problem domain  which is defined by a set of representational primitives  a set of goalstates or problems expressed in terms of those p r i m i t i v e s   and procedures tor solving tnose problems. 
plans 
the most common of the domains in talespin uses the primitives oi roger schank's conceptual dependency   1     and i t s problems and procedures come from a theory of plans by roger schank and robert abelson   1   . tale-spin uses these plans to generate stories; wilensky's pam system  uses them for understanding stories. 
　　　the f i r s t kind of plan is c a l l a delta-act  and they are defined in terms of a particular goalstate. deltaprox x y z  is the delta-act that is i n voked when x wants y to be near   prox   z. similarly  delta-control x y z  means x wants y to control z  delia-know x q  means that x wants to find out the answer to the question q  and tell x y z  means that x wants y to know z. there are  negative  counterparts to these: delta-neg-prox x  z  means that x wants 
y to get away from z  and so on. each delta-act consists of a number of techniques called planboxes tor achieving the desired goal  and an algorithm for deciding the order in which to try the planboxes. the planboxes have a variety of pre- and post-conditions on them  and if successful  they eventually produce an event of some sort. 
　　　here's what 	the 	f i r s t 	planbox 	in delta-prox looks l i k e : 
planbox 1: x t r i e s to move y to z preconditions: 
x is self-movable 
if x is d i f f e r e n t from y  then dprox  x  x  y  and do-grasp  x  y  
dknow  x  where is z   
dknow  x  where is x   
　dlink  x  loc  z   act: do-ptrans  x  y  loc  z   postcondition: 
is y really at z   dknow could have goofed  
postact: if x is different from y  then do-neg-grasp  x  y  
　　　x w i l l try to move y to z. if x is not the same as y  then x must get himself near y  and then somehow grab on to y  so that y w i l l be carried along. 
a precondition for planbox 1 is that 
x be able to move himself. if that i s n ' t the case  or if the planbox f a i l s   we try another planbox. 
　　　the next precondition on planbox 1 is that x find out where z i s . if z is a fixed physical location  then nothing needs to be done; we assume that everyone knows where places are. if z is not a location  z might be a person  for i n stance    then we use the delta-act for finding out information  delta-know. 
　　　the next precondition is that x find out where he himself i s . x must know where he is in order to go anywhere. including this test allows the p o s s i b i l i t y that x does not know where he is and must therefore find out. thus  we can t e l l stories  solve problems  in which characters are l o s t . 
　　　the next precondition is that x be able to figure out a route to z. the solution to this problem uses the knowledge about the physical world  which i discuss below in the section on maps. 
　　　finally  we use do-ptrans to effect the actual movement  and if x had picked up y  he now lets y go. the dknow postcondition allows for the p o s s i b i l i t y that the dknow precondition may have been satisfied u n f a i r l y . in one of talespin 's stories  arthur bear asks george bird where some honey i s . george l i e s   and arthur believes him. as far as the f i r s t dknow was concerned  the precondition was s a t i s f i e d : arthur thinks he knows where the honey i s . when he gets there  however  he discovers that the honey actually i s n ' t there  so he goes back to do another dknow  hopefully more successful. 
natural lan*ua :e-1: 
1 　　　other planboxes in delta-prox i n clude: x gets y to move himself to z; x gets z to move himself to y; x gets a t h i r d party to move y to z; x gets a t h i r d party to move z to y. other planboxes  not yet implemented  include: x gets y and z to be in some common location  x gets some  system  to move y to z  gravity  the post office  whatever 's appropriate . 
　　　closely related to the delta-acts is the persuade package  a handy collection of planboxes used by many delta-acts. these include simple requests  proposing a good reason  bargaining  and threatening . 
　　　i t ' s easy to see how the plans relate to each other as subgoals. in order to get something  delta-control   you may need to find out where it is  deltaknow    which may require that you go ask someone  delta-prox and tell  who may bargain with you  persuade   which may cause you to get sometning for him  delta-contrul   and so on. 
sigma-states: the budlly needs hunger  t h i r s t   rest  an 1 sex are tour physical needs that are primitives in this domain. one of the ways in which these goals are most unlike the plans is that they arise as goals every so often  spontaneously. they c a l l the plans as subgoals but are not themselves subgoals of any plan or of each other. for example  an obvious planbox under sigma-hunger requires the use of delta-control - for obtaining food - but for what end would becoming hungry be a means  
l e v e l . if you feel that you're competing with the other person  or if there's a substantial imbalance of power between you  or great differences in social class  or hatred  and so on  you won't ask. second  they appear as consequences to many actions. when someone atranses a g i f t to you  not only do you possess i t   you probably feel some affection towards that person as w e l l . 
　　　what about the problem-solving procedures in this domain  well  they exist  certainly.  john wanted mary to like him  - sounds okay. the difference is that they don't seem to exist as goals  but on y as subgoals  the exact opposite of the sigma-states. furthermore  there's a l o t less certainty about them  while there are v i r t u a l l y guaranteed procedures for john to get from new york to london  there are no algorithms for john to get mary to l i k e him  which says no more than that the  physics  of the real world is simpler - or better understood - than the  physics  of the mind. 
personalities 
to describe character t r a i t s   tale-spin attributes degrees of kindness  vanity  honesty  and intelligence to i t s charac-

　　　tale-spin knows what kinds of food different characters eat  but it assumes that water is s u f f i c i e n t to quench anyone's t h i r s t .  in some ways  i t ' s s t i l l a very sparse world.  people sleep only at home  but they may  fool around  with whomever they please.  in other ways  i t ' s not so sparse.  
　　　the sigma-states are the top-level goals tale-spin works on. after the user has chosen the i n i t i a l setting and selected a main character  ne can choose one of the sigma-states as the f i r s t goal for that cnaracter. are tnese stories  then  about nunger  t h i r s t   and so on  not necessarily. as w e ' l l see in the section called stories  the focus or point of a story may be entirely separate from the f i r s t goal. 
relationships 
tale-spin characterizes relationships between people in terms of competition  dominance  f a m i l i a r i t y   a f f e c t i o n   t r u s t   deceit  and indebtedness. i t ' s perhaps harder in this domain than in any other to find a good set of primitives that are both necessary and s u f f i c i e n t . the relationships are used in two ways. f i r s t   they serve as preconditions to many of the planboxes  p a r t i c u l a r l y in persuade. before you ask someone to do something for you  you have to be near him 
 delta-prox  and so on  but you must also consider how you relate on a personal ters. these t r a i t s are used in a  solo  environment  having the least dependence  among the domains we've seen so far  on anything else in the world. if john has been asked to do a favor  and there are no good   external  reasons for or against i t   he may do it if he's a kind person. compliments to a vain person w i l l produce a greater reaction than to a modest person  as w e ' l l see in  the fox and the crow.  dishonesty is a precond i t i o n to the   s t e a l   planbox in deltacontrol. insulting someone's i n t e l l i gence produces a marked change in affect i o n . a l l these reactions are part of tale-spin's inference mechanism. 
　　　these t r a i t s are undoubtedly useful but seem to be only mildly d i f f e r e n t from relationships  u n t i l you think about procedures for achieving personality t r a i t s . there aren't any  at least none that succeed over anything but long stretches of time  too long for them to be of use as subgoals. otherwise  the following scenario would make sense: 
　　　 mary needed a new dress and wanted to get some cash from her husband john. 'how can i do that ' she wondered. 'oh sure  i ' l l just make him dishonest so h e ' l l rob a bank. gee  i better make him smart enough not to get caught. okay  t h a t ' l l work. john '

       i d e f i n e a map  to be the r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of a group of contiguous regions  submaps   a f i x e d - s i z e p i c t u r e   if you w i l l   where a l l maps have approximately tne same r e s o l u t i o n . my map of c a l i f o r nia i n c l u d e s a submap of soutnern c a l i f o r n i a   which nas a suomap for i r v i n e   whicn has a suomap for uci  and so on. 
       the c o n t e n t s of a map depend on exp e r i e n c e   having l i v e d most of my l i f e in c o n n e c t i c u t   my map for t h a t s t a t e has some very d e t a i l e d submaps. never having been to utah  however  i imagine it to be a vaguely r e c t a n g u l a r area  p e r f e c t l y b l a n k   w i t h o u t so much as a s i n g l e c i t y on the map.  of course  i might r e c o g nize t h a t a g i v e n c i t y is in utah  but t h a t ' s a d i f f e r e n t i s s u e .   
       tale-spin uses maps to solve the problem of f i n d i n g routes from one place to another. there are two kinds of r o u t e problems  i n t e r - m a p and i n t r a - m a p . to solve the i n t e r - m a p problem  i t f i n d s the l o w e s t - l e v e l map t h a t includes both the o r i g i n and the d e s t i n a t i o n as submaps  or submaps of submaps  and so o n . then it solves the i n t r a - m a p problem of g e t t i n g 
       from one of the submaps of t h a t map to the o t n e r . s o l v i n g the intra-map problem r e q u i r e s t h a t we represent adjacency  so t h a t we can f i n d the path from one to the o t n e r . crossing tne border between a map and one ot i t s adjacent maps r e q u i r e s t h a t we mark p o i n t s of i n t e r s e c t i o n ; i c a l l tnem d o o r s . the r e l a t i o n s h i p of a s t r e e t corner to a s t r e e t is much l i k e 
       the r e l a t i o n s h i p of a door to a room each is a way of g e t t i n g from one r e g i o n to an a d j a c e n t one - so both of them are   d o o r s   in the map system. 
       every door has two conceptual images  one f o r each region to which it is a t t a c h e d . people o f t e n use d i f f e r e n t terms to r e f e r to a s i n g l e door  and they know t h a t doors are not symmetric  as in the case of a door locked from the o u t side but not the i n s i d e . knowledge about doors can be incomplete - not knowing where it l e a d s   for example. and sometimes we d o n ' t even r e a l i z e t h a t two doors are a c t u a l l y one and the same; s t r e e t i n t e r s e c t i o n s approached along d i f f e r e n t s t r e e t s may look e n t i r e l y d i f f e r e n t . 
       in tale-spin  each door has two names t h a t are marked as being   e q u i v a l e n t   ; each name represents a map. every map p o i n t s to the super-map to which it belongs and to a l i s t of i t s submaps as w e l l . 
       tale-spin also uses an a b s t r a c t i o n of maps c a l l e d b l u e p r i n t s   which d i f f e r from maps by having a p r o p e r t y of m i n i -
m a l i t y . the map for a p a r t i c u l a r o f f i c e b u i l d i n g may have 1 submaps r e p r e s e n t i n g v a r i o u s f l o o r s o f o f f i c e s   but the b l u e p r i n t for the g e n e r i c o f f i c e b u i l d i n g c o n t a i n s o n l y one s u b - b l u e p r i n t for each d i f f e r e n t kind of f l o o r   say  one for basements  one for the ground f l o o r   and one for o f f i c e f l o o r s . maps are i n s t a n t i a t i o n s of b l u e p r i n t s   and tale-spin uses b l u e p r i n t s w h i l e i n t e r a c t i n g w i t h 
the user to c o n s t r u c t the maps for a l l p h y s i c a l spaces. 
       the goal s t r u c t u r e   for example  s t a r t e d w i t h the c l a s s i c a l stack o f g o a l s . there are s t o r i e s which r e q u i r e n o t h i n g more c o m p l i c a t e d . but by the end of the p r o j e c t   tale-spin used a mechanism t h a t was l e s s elegant but was adequate f o r a l a r g e r c l a s s of s t o r i e s .

　　　the simple goalstack proves inadequate when we i n s i s t that no more e f f o r t be expended on achieving a subgoal than is allotted to achieving the goal. in p a r t i c u l a r   we must avoid trying to achieve a subgoal which is identical to the goal. a case where this was not done is the sixth mis-spun tale above. 
　　　since there is more than one problem-solving character in a story  we need separate goal l i s t s for each of them.

chieved  it is removed from the goal l i s t . it a goal that was on the l i s t t a i l s   it is marked but not removed  lest it be tried again and again  leading to another mis-spun t a l e . 
　　　the current goal system is a tar cry from the simple stack  but there's more to come. part of the ongoing research at uc1 on this project is to extend the cap a b i l i t i e s of the goal calculus in a number of ways. f i r s t   the goal structure must indicate the various kinds of relations between goals: x is the subgoal of y; x    and z are concurrent goals; x  y  and z must be achieved in that order; x is subdivided into a  b  and c  for example  allocating portions of a sum of money to individual purchases  ; and so on. 
　　　second  there are new goal processes: recognizing when a goal has been superseded; recognizing when a goal can safely be abandoned   joe bear was on his way to ask irving bird where to find some honey when he suddenly came across a blueberry bush  ; recognizing when a goal should be r e - t r i e d   in l i g h t of new information  when  mildly hungry  turns into  desperate for food  . 
　　　third  tnere is recovery  which is different from both achievement and preservation. some expenditures  such as cash  can often be recovered; it you buy an item in a department store  and then decide  or find out  that you don't need it  for some other goal   you may be able to return it and get your money back  or part of i t   or some equivalent. time expenditures  on the other hand  are non-recover able. 
　　　this new work is related 	to 	knowledge 	about 	the nature of process  which we are also interested in 	modeling  	and which  	not surprisingly  begins to sound 
like ideas from automatic programming. 
stories 
when is a text a story  and when is it simply a narration of rational events  what's a story about  and how can you t e l l   
 1  one day joe bear was famished. he closed his eyes for three seconds. he wasn't hungry any more. the end. 
 1  one day joe bear was famished. there was a jar of honey right next to him. he ate the honey. the end. 
　　　tale-spin starts a story by creating a problem for the main character  drawn from the four sigma-states mentioned e a r l i e r . many subproblems may be encountered on the way  and there can be side-effects that are problems that need solving as w e l l . the degree of d i f f i culty is in part determined by the user. in specifying how well one character gets along with another  he can make the problem harder to solve  which also makes the story longer. in fact  i have observed that people who run the program usually make the problem very hard; they find the resulting  trials and tribulations  story more  interesting   their word  than  sweetness and light  stories where a l l the characters like each other and do favors at the least suggestion. 
　　　but that approach confines the point of the story to the l i t e r a l l e v e l . to go higher than that  we need to understand what story points are and how to model them. 
natural lanuage-1: meehan 
1 　　　i chose to work on the aesop fables as examples of simple stories whose points  or morals  are not about animals  but are  instead  concerned with general lessons  notions from a higher domain. to produce a story with a given moral  we must f i r s t understand the correspondence between the moral and the real-world l e v e l . for example  the moral of  the fox and the crow  is never trust flatter-ers ers. the analysis is as follows: 
　　　 never do x  means that if you do x  then something  bad  w i l l happen.  a f l a t t e r s b  means that a says something  nice  to b  but is insincere  doing it for some u l t e r i o r motive. since a consequence of saying something nice to b is that b w i l l become more kindly disposed towards a  then i t ' s reasonable to assume that b's kind disposition towards a w i l l enable something to happen which is  good  for a. putting this a l l together  we predict that a has some goal which requires that b be kindly disposed towards a  so a says something nice to b  b reacts accordingly  and something happens that causes a to achieve his goal and also causes b to sutler. since transfer of ownership is an event that is simultaneously good for tne recipient and dad for the unwilling donor  we know that 
delta-cowtrol can be the main problem  when the program operates in this mode  it sets some of the i n i t i a l parameters of the world in such a way that when characters behave reasonably in that environment -- and reasonable behavior is what the simulator does - the desired story w i l l r e s u l t . in other words  to make a certain point in a story  it f i g ures out in advance what some of the world model has to look l i k e   how the stage must be set before the characters arr ive. 
the english generator 
as a problem ctomain  this one is unique in that it provides no information to the other domains  although it uses their information extensively. for example  in 
order to be able to say  joe bear r et urned to the cave  instead of  joe bear went to the cave   the generator needs access to the memory to check whether joe bear has been in that cave before. when describing someone's t r i p   it uses the map*system 's knowledge and expresses the route in d e t a i l ; e . g .    tom walked from the ground by the redwood tree across the meadow through the valley across a meadow to the patch of ground.  but apart from making use of a l l the domains in order to find a better way to express something  the generator is very straightforward. it doesn't even use a grammar  given such a rich set of meaning representations to start with. interested readers should consult the thesis  for d e t a i l s . 
more stories 
here are two stories generated 	by 	talespin  	i 	present here a translation done by hand  for ease of 	reading. 	a l l 	the events 	in the story were produced by the program; 	only the english is mine. 
the fox and the crow 
　　　 once upon a time   there was a d i s honest fox named her nry who lived in a cave  and a vain and t: rusting crow named joe who 1 ived in an elm tree. joe had gotten a piece of chee: se and was holding i t in his mouth. on' e day  henry walked from his cave  across the meadow to the elm tree. he saw joe crow and the cheese and became hungry. he decided that he might get the cheese if joe crow spoke  so he told joe that he liked his singing very much and wantei d to hear him sing. joe was ver y pleased w ith henry and began to sing. the cheese e f e l l out of his mouth  down to the gro und. henry picked up the ch eese and to id joe crow that he was stupid. joe was angry  and didn't trust henr y anymore. henry returned to his cave. ii 
joe bear and jack bear 
　　　 once upon a time  there were two bears named jack and joe  and a bee named sam. jack was very friendly with sam but very competitive with joe  who was a dishonest bear. one day  jack was hungry. he knew that sam bee had some honey and that he might be able to persuade sam to give him some. he walked from his cave  down the mountain t r a i l   across the valley  over the bridge  to the oak tree where sam bee l i v e d . he asked sam for some honey. sam gave him some. then joe bear walked over to the oak tree and saw 
jack bear holding the honey. he thought that he might get the honey if jack put it down  so he told him that he d i d n ' t think jack could run very fast. jack accepted this challenge and decided to run. he put down the honey and ran over the bridge and across the valley. joe picked up the honey and went home.  
　　　　　　　　　conclusions storytelling is a natural   language processing a c t i v i t y that requires many kinds of knowledge  not simply large quantities of i t . i t ' s not a limited-domain task  and rather than try to make a l l the knowledge look the same  i take the opposite position - use the primitives  problems  and procedures that seem most appropriate to the domain. the control structure i t s e l f   the goal calculus  is a second-order problem domain that integrates various forms of knowledge and simulates goal-driven characters  avoiding the use of such  formal  techniques as backtracking. with this knowledge  we can write simple  reasonable stories; without it we qet some bizarre tales.
