an incomplete taxonomy is proposed for the knowledge of actions a computer must have if it is to understand stories about people performing these actions. the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n is along two dimensions  force - why a person should follow the rule  and form - what the rule looks l i k e . four kinds of force are distinguished  s t r i c t   social  suggested  and regulatory  while six forms are d i s tinguished  subactions  substates  side conditions  methods  time orderings  and do-whiles. for the most part it seems that any force type may combine with any form type in producing a r u l e . one example  how to use an umbrella  is examined in d e t a i l although facts about many human a c t i v i t i e s   from playing bridge to washing one's hair  are used as examples.

       it is commonly accepted t h a t a computer which answers q u e s t i o n s about a n a t u r a l language t e x t must have r o u g h l y a human r e a d e r ' s knowledge of the s u b j e c t m a t t e r . r e s t r i c t i n g o u r s e l v e s t o simple s t o r i e s  1 ike c h i l d r e n ' s s t o r i e s   the knowledge needed is t h a t  common sense  knowledge 
which a l l members of a p a r t i c u l a r c u l t u r e share. since  b y a l l i n d i c a t i o n s even t h i s knowledge i s q u i t e e x t e n s i v e   i t w i l l have t o b e w e l l o r g a n i z e d and c l a s s i f i e d b e f o r e a computer w i l l be able to make much use of i t . in t h i s paper i w i l l be concerned w i t h c l a s s i f y i n g the k i n d s of f a c t s we have about a c t i o n s . some t y p i c a l f a c t s of the s o r t i w i l l b e concerned w i t h a r e :

c o n s i d e r : 
fred was t h i n k i n g of g e t t i n g a k i t e to g i v e 
to bob f o r h i s b i r t h d a y . then fred l e a r n e d t h a t bob had a k i t e and d i d not want a n o t h e r . 
if we were to ask whether fred w i l l s t i l l buy a k i t e   the answer would be something l i k e   p r o bably n o t   . if asked why  the response would be  because bob does not want a k i t e   . if we assume a f a c t l i k e  f1  these responses are easy to account f o r . indeed t h e r e seems to be no o t h e r o p t i o n than to assume something on the o r d e r of  f1 . but need the f a c t be  f1  i t s e l f   that i s   perhaps t h e r e are more b a s i c f a c t s which combine to produce  f1   and what people know are these more b a s i c f a c t s r a t h e r than  f1 . showing t h a t t h i s i s n o t the case i s the second p a r t o f   f 1   ' s j u s t i f i c a t i o n and i t i s i n general q u i t e d i f f i c u l t . a l l one can u s u a l l y do is to examine a few possi b l e a l t e r n a t i v e s   show them f a l s e   and then p u t t h e burden of p r o o f on anyone who o b j e c t s to the p u t a t i v e f a c t . so  f o r example  we can see t h a t  f1  is a f a c t about p r e s e n t g i v i n g   r a t h e r than one about g i v i n g in g e n e r a l   since it would not be t r u e f o r a p o l i c e m a n ' s g i v i n g somebody a p a r k i n g t i c k e t . 1 c o u l d go f u r t h e r and show t h a t  f1  cannot even be g e n e r a l i z e d to g i v i n g   u s e f u l   t h i n g s   u n l i k e p a r k i n g t i c k e t s     but w i l l not d o so h e r e .  see  charniak 1  f o r a deeper a n a l y s i s

fred bought bob a k i t e f o r h i s b i r t h d a y .  1 hope bob wants a k i t e   thought fred. 
of c o u r s e   what p r e v e n t s  f1  from r e a l l y b e i n g a pr is t h a t  r1    p r ' s must h o l d f o r the a c t i o n to t a k e place  does n o t h o l d f o r  f1 . that i s   i t is p e r f e c t l y p o s s i b l e to gi ve somebody a present 
he does not l i k e . however  a r u l e very s i m i l a r to  rl  does apply f o r  f1   namely: 
 r1  	if s t a t e 	s is a n o n - s t r i c t pr of a c t i o n a  then 	it 	is a good idea 	f o r 	s to h o l d j u s t p r i o r 	t o a ' s b e i n g done. 
what we are doing then is to d i s t i n g u i s h between s t r i c t p r ' s   which obey   r l     and n o n - s t r i c t p r ' s   which obey  r1 . so  rl  would now r e a d : 
 r1  	if s t a t e 	s 	is a s t r i c t pr of a c t i o n a  	then s must 	h o l d j u s t p r i o r to a ' s b e i n g done. 
	another d i s t i n c t i o n 	between 	s t r i c t 	and n o n - s t r i c t 
	p r ' s 	i s : 
	 r1  	if an a c t i o n a 	is done a l t h o u g h a s t r i c t pr 
	is broken we ask 	 how  	it was done t h a t way. 
	if a 	n o n - s t r i c t pr 	is broken we ask 	 why  	it 
was done t h a t way.

existence or non-existence of d i s t i n c t i o n s 	l i k e t h i s one. 	however  our problem in t h i s paper is a d i f f e r e n t one. 	simply  do ordinary people in everyday conversation make such a d i s t i n c t i o n   	i myself tend to doubt i t   but my opinions either way are not very strong  	so i w i l l l i s t t h i s d i s t i n c t i o n when i sum things up l a t e r   but put a 
question mark beside i t . 
	vi 	social versus suggested pre-requisites 
       so far we have only investigated one type of n o n - s t r i c t pr which  for reasons which w i l l soon be apparent  we w i l l c a l l   s o c i a l   pr. another kind of n o n - s t r i c t pr is a  suggested  pr. for example: 
 f1  having a t a i l on a k i t e is a suggested pr o f f l y i n g i t . 
reason: 	it makes f l y i n g the k i t e easier  f1  having paper  or otherwise uncared about 
material around and if possible under an object is a suggested pr of painting that object. reason: one is less l i k e l y to get paint on other things.  f1  being sober is a suggested pr of d r i v i n g . reason: less l i k e l y to have an accident t h i s way. one difference between social and suggested p r ' s is immediately obvious. suggested p r ' s are backed up with reasons for the suggestion  while social p r ' s   l i k e  f1  or  f1  do not have reasons things are simply  done that way . having a reason for a suggestion allows us to relate the breaking 
of a suggested pr to certain d i f f i c u l t i e s experienced in performing the action. 	for example: 
  a   j a c k did not put paper  c  he got paint under the chair before over every-
	he painted it 	thing 
  b   j a c k did not clean the | d  the paint did chair before he pain- not coat well. ted i t . 
if we combine  a  with  c   or  b  with  d  the stories make sense  but the two other combinations do not make connected s t o r i e s . our comprehension model could account for such cases with a r u l e like: 
 r1  if a suggested pr fof an action a is broken  then associate the negation of the reason for f  if it occurs  with the breaking of the suggested pr. 
another difference between social and suggested p r ' s is that social p r ' s are much more subject to opinion than suggested p r ' s   and probably any representation of social p r ' s w i l l have to allocate space for an indicator which shows which class of people believed in t h i s p a r t i c u l a r pr and at which period in time. so some social p r ' s which at the current time divide people are: 
 f1  	having no foreign matter in the mouth is a social pr of t a l k i n g . 
 f1  	wearing whites is a social pr for playing tennis. 
　　　another d i s t i n c t i o n between the two is that social p r ' s have a  moral  component which we do not f i n d in suggested p r ' s . 	for example: 
tom f e l t g u i l t y using b i l l ' s baseball without. asking him f i r s t . 
mr. jones was embarrassed playing tennis in h i s street clothes. 
i am making the i m p l i c i t claim here that embarrassment and g u i l t spring from breaking the same kinds of r u l e s   and the d i s t i n c t i o n is due to the p a r t i cular circumstances and the strength of the f e e l i n g . this would seem to be supported by examples l i k e : 
 f1  being correct is a social pr of giving somebody information. 
when mr. jones realised that he had given the d r i v e r wrong directions he f e l t g u i l t y / embarrassed. 
in t h i s last example either emotion would be reasonable  but presumably in both cases it would spring from the breaking of rule  f1 . on the other hand there are clear cut cases where between the two   g u i l t and embarrassment  only one is appropriate. so whether one should d i s t i n g u i s h between social and moral p r ' s or not is by no means clear. i have somewhat a r b i t r a r i l y chosen the l a t t e r a l t e r n a t i v e . 
　　　note that it is p e r f e c t l y possible to feel g u i l t y about breaking a suggested pr. for example  it is possible  one might even say preferable  for a person to feel g u i l t y about d r i v i n g while drunk. however  it is surely the case that t h i s is not due simply to breaking the suggested pr  but rather that in breaking the suggested pr one is also breaking a social rule of the form   i t is bad to put l i v e s or property in danger  especially through carelessness or thoughtlessness . to see t h a t it must be a rule l i k e t h i s which is responsible f o r g u i l t a f t e r breaking suggested p r ' s   note that it is hard to imagine feeling g u i l t y over not p u t t i n g 
a t a i l on one's k i t e . 	on the other hand  	if for some strange reason  somebody's l i f e depended on your getting the k i t e up q u i c k l y   it would be easy to imagine feeling g u i l t y over f o r g e t t i n g to put 
on the t a i l . 
　　　hence  another rule which distinguishes social from suggested p r ' s i s : 
 r1  	breaking a social pr which one accepts is often a cause of g u i l t or embarrassment. 
	v i i 	pre-requisites and t h e i r force 
       it is perhaps a good time to step back for a second and look again at what we have been doing. so far we have accumulated three kinds of pr's.s o c i a l   suggested  and s t r i c t . 	in each case these facts mentioned some state which ought to be s a t i s f i e d p r i o r to an action taking place. 	what d i f fered from type to type was why the state should be s a t i s f i e d . 	to put t h i s s l i g h t l y d i f f e r e n t l y   what d i f f e r e d was what would happen if we d i s obeyed  so to speak  the p r e - r e q u i s i t e . 	what we have been c l a s s i f y i n g then ie  pre-requisite

f o r c o     	t h a t 	i s   	the   d r i v i n g power  	behind those var lous pr r u l e s . 	as we 	will 	see l a t e r   these same k i n d s of f o r c e s apply e q u a l l y w e l l 	to o t h e r k i n d s of 	knowledge about 	a c t i o n s   	so r e a l l y then we have been making a c a t a l o g u e of   f o r c e s   . 	that in each case we saw the 	f o r c e a p p l i e d to a pr r e l a t i o n was s i m p l y 	f o r ease of p r e s e n t a t i o n .

　　　sections four through e i g h t of t h i s paper were devoted to a c l a s s i f i c a t i o n of the d i f f e r e n t kinds of force  in each case as applied to the pr form  and hence to the substate form . in the l a s t two sections we have introduced three new forma  but have not shown which forces they take  except that our analysis of umbrellas showed that most a l l of the forms occur with both s t r i c t and suggested force. in f a c t   a l l of the forms we have seen so far combine with a l l the forces. to i l l u s t r a t e t h i s l e t us look at some social and regulatory force examples  f1 - f1 . 
social rules 
subactions 
	 f1  	when you get married  give a party. 
 f1  	when you make a phone c a l l   announce your name. 
methods 
 f1  	to get a waiter's a t t e n t i o n in a restaur a n t   make a small gesture at him while he is looking in your d i r e c t i o n . 
 f1  	to cut something while eating  use your k n i f e held in your r i g h t hand. 
time orderings 
 f1  have permission to use object belonging to someone else p r i o r to using i t . 
 f1  	announce your name on the phone f i r s t t h i n g . 
regulations 
subactions 
	 f1  	bidding is part of bridge. 
 f1  	when making a turn while d r i v i n g one must s i g n a l . 
methods 
 f1  	in some shops it is necessary to have a numbered s l i p i n d i c a t i n g your place in the serving queue; 	one must obtain t h i s

s l i p from the normal dispenser. 
 f1  	in many i t a l i a n bars one pays by f i r s t t e l l i n g the cashier what one wants  giving her the money  and getting a receipt which is in turn given to the barman. 
time orderings 
 f1  it is necessary to obtain the s l i p mentioned in  f1  a f t e r entering the shop on the current buying t r i p . 
 f1  in bridge the dummy is layed down a f t e r the f i r s t card is played  but before the second. 
	xii 	other forms 
　　　the four forms we have investigated so far hardly exhaust the p o s s i b i l i t i e s . in this section we w i l l look at two more  but more in the s p i r i t of ongoing i n q u i r y   rather than f inished products. 
　　　our four et;tabl ished forms can be put into two classes. one class  which 1 will call  occurrence statements  consists of those statements which describe some action or state which should occur. naturally  substates and subactions f a l l under t h i s heading. another form which is also in the category is  side c o n d i t i o n   . a side 
condition is an event or state which in some sense describes a second state or a c t i o n . for example  a side condition of moving the flanqe up the s t i c k of the umbrella is that the canopy raises at the same time and to the same degree. note that  on one hand this does not q u a l i f y as a separate suba c t i o n   that is one does not extend the canopy separately from r a i s i n g the flange  yet we cannot simply ignore thi s d i r e c t r e l a t i o n between the two events. for example  it enables us to understand how a canopy could be half extended. another example of a side condition i s : 
 f1  	paint being l e f t on the paint brush is a side condition of t r a n s f e r r i n g paint 	from the brush to the object being painted. 
	force : 	 strict  
notice that both of these side conditions have s t r i c t force. at the moment i do not know if other kinds of force are possible. 
　　　we have said that side conditions are  occurrence statements  along with substates and subacts time ordering statements and method statements on the other hand f a l l into the category of  control statements . control statements t e l l us not what needs doing  but rather when or how to do i t . the obvious analogy is with control information in programs  with ordering r e l a t i o n s corresponding to the i m p l i c i t ordering of program statements  and method statements corresponding to subroutine c a l l s . this analogy suggests that there ought to be other kinds of control information needed to describe actions  and indeed there are. one part i c u l a r is the  do-while  statement. so in painting  using a brush  we know to dip the brush in the paint and then transfer the paint to the object. however  it is necessary in general to repeat these two steps u n t i l the job is done. this is a s t r i c t do-while statement  but do-whiles occur with other forces also. 
 f1   in washing one's hair one rubs soap into the hair and then rinses it o f f . repeat these two steps u n t i l soap 1 athers e a s i l y .

       what i have done in t h i s paper then is to c l a s s i f y knowledge about actions according to two c r i t e r i a   the force behind the rule  that i s   why you should follow the rule  and the form of the rule  or what the rule looks l i k e   . as such  the paper can be summarized in diagrams  d1  and  d1 . the question marks in the diagrams indicate d i s t i n c t i o n s which i am not sure need be made. in  d1  the numbers following the force types i n d i cate rules in the paper which the force type obeys. 
       i have so far not mentioned other people's work in r e l a t i o n to the results presented in t h i s paper. space l i m i t a t i o n s prevent any d e t a i l e d discussion  but obviously t h i s work was not done in a vacuum  and there are several papers which 
have influenced i t . some p a r t i c u l a r influences are: the  absolute  vs  reasonable  conditions on actions found in  schank 1   the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n of inference types of  rieger 1   the   i n f e l e c i t i e s   of  austin 1   the idea of   i n s t i t u t i o n a l facts  found in  searle 1   and the  frames  r e presentation of  minsky 1 .
