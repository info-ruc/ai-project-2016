 
       commonsense reasoning is  nonmonotonic  in the sense that we o f t e n draw conclusions on the basis of p a r t i a l i n f o r m a t i o n that we r e t r a c t when 
we are given more complete i n f o r m a t i o n . some of the most i n t e r e s t i n g products of the recent attempts to formalize nonmonotonic reasoning are the nonmonotonic l o g i c s of mcdermott and doyle  mcdermott and doyle  1   mcdermott  1 . these l o g i c s   however  a l l have p e c u l i a r i t i e s that suggest they do not q u i t e succeed in capturing the i n t u i t i o n s that prompted t h e i r development. in t h i s paper we give a r e c o n s t r u c t i o n of

introduction 
       it has become g e n e r a l l y acknowledged in recent years that one important feature of o r d i n a r y commonsense reasoning that standard l o g i c s f a l l to capture is i t s nonmonotonicity. an example f r e q u e n t l y given to i l l u s t r a t e the point is the f o l l o w i n g : if we know that tweety is a b i r d   in the absence of evidence to the c o n t r a r y   we w i l l normally assume that tweety can f l y . i f   however  we l a t e r l e a r n that tweety is a penguin  we w i l l withdraw our p r i o r assumption if we t r y to model t h i s in a formal system  we seem to have 
a s i t u a t i o n where a theorem p is d e r i v a b l e from a set of axioms s  but is not d e r i v a b l e from some set s' that is a superset of s. thus the set of theorems does not increase monotonically w i t h the set of axioms; hence t h i s sort of reasoning is said to be  nonmonotonic.  as minsky  has pointed out  standard l o g i c s are always monotonlc  because t h e i r inference rules make every axiom permissive. that i s   the inference r u l e s are always of the form  p is a theorem if q1  qn are theorems   so new axioms can only make more theorems d e r i v a b l e ; they can never r e s u l t in a previous theorem being i n v a l i d a t e d . 
       recently  there have been a number of attempts to formalize t h i s type of nonmonotonic reasoning. the general idea is to allow axioms to be r e s t r i c t i v e as w e l l as permissive  by employing inference rules of the form  p is a theorem if q 1 ' '     q n are not theorems.  the inference that birds can f l y is handled by having  in e f f e c t   a r u l e that says that for any x   x can f l y   is a theorem if  x is a b i r d   is a theorem and  x cannot f l y   is not a theorem. if a l l we are t o l d 
       about tweety is that he is a b i r d   then we w i l l not be able to derive  tweety cannot f l y     and the inference to  tweety can f l y   w i l l go through. if 
we are t o l d that tweety is a penguin and we know that no penquin can f l y   we w i l l be able to derive the f a c t that tweety cannot f l y   and the inference that tweety can f l y w i l l be blocked. 
       one of the most i n t e r e s t i n g embodiments of t h i s approach to nonmonotonic reasoning is mcdermott and doyle's  nonmonotonic l o g i c    mcdermott and doyle  1   mcdermott  1 . mcdermott and doyle modify a standard f i r s t - o r d e r l o g i c by i n t r o d u c i n g a s e n t e n t i a l operator  m  whose i n f o r m a l i n t e r p r e t a t i o n is   i s c o n s i s t e n t .   nonmonotonic inferences about b i r d s being able to f l y would be licensed in t h e i r system by the axiom 
 mcdermott  1  p. 	1  
 all x  bird x  	/  m can-fly x   	-  can-fly x  . 
this formula can be read i n f o r m a l l y as  for a l l x  if x is a b i r d and it is consistent to assert that x can f l y   then x can f l y .   mcdermott and doyle can then have a s i n g l e   general nonmonotonic inference r u l e   whose i n t u i t i v e content is  mp is d e r i v a b l e if ~p is not d e r i v a b l e .   
       mcdermott and doyle's approach to nonmonotonic reasoning seems more i n t e r e s t i n g and ambitious than some other approaches in two respects. f i r s t   since the p r i n c i p l e s that lead to nonmonotonic inferences are e x p l i c i t l y represented in the l o g i c   those very p r i n c i p l e s can be reasoned about in the l o g i c . that i s   if p is such a p r i n c i p l e   we could s t a r t out b e l i e v i n g q -  p or even mp -  p  and come to hold p by making i n f e r e n c e s   e i t h e r monotonic or nonmonotonic. so  if we represent the b e l i e f that b i r d s can f l y in mcdermott and doyle's way  we could also represent various inferences that would lead us to adopt that b e l i e f . second  since they use only general inference r u l e s   they are able to provide a formal semantic i n t e r p r e t a t i o n w i t h 

soundness and completeness proofs for each of the l o g i c s they d e f i n e . in formalisms that use c o n t e n t - s p e c i f i c nonmonotonic inference rules dealing w i t h contingent aspects of the world   i . e .   it might have been the case that birds could not f l y     it is d i f f i c u l t to see how t h i s could be done. the e f f e c t is that the nonmonotonic inferences in mcdermott and doyle's l o g i c s are j u s t i f i e d by the meaning of the formulas i n v o l v e d . 
       there are a number of problems w i t h mcdermott and doyle's nonmonotonic l o g i c s   however. the f i r s t logic they define  mcdermott and doyle  1  gives such a weak notion of consistency t h a t   as they point out  mp is not inconsistent 
w i t h ~p. that i s   it is possible for a theory to assert simultaneously that p is consistent with the theory and that p is f a l s e . subsequently mcdermott  t r i e d basing nonmonotonic logics on the standard modal logics t  s1  and s1. mcdermott discovered  however  that the most p l a u s i b l e candidate for capturing the notion of consistency that he wanted  nonmonotonic s1  collapses to ordinary s1 and is therefore monotonic in the rest of t h i s paper we show why 
these problems a r i s e and how to avoid them. 
ii 	nonmonotonic logic and autoepistemic reasoning 
       the f i r s t step in analyzing nonmonotonic l o g i c is to determine what sort of nonmonotonic reasoning it is meant to model. after a l l   nonmonotoniclty is a rather abstract s y n t a c t i c property of an inference system  and there is no a p r i o r i reason to believe that a l l forms of nonmonotonic reasoning should have the same l o g i c a l basis. in f a c t   mcdermott and doyle seem to confuse two quite d i s t i n c t forms of nonmonotonic reasoning  which we w i l l c a l l default reasoning and autoeplstemlc reasoning. they t a l k as though t h e i r systems are intended to model the former  but they a c t u a l l y seem much b e t t e r suited to modeling the l a t t e r . 
       by d e f a u l t reasoning  we mean drawing p l a u s i b l e inferences from less than conclusive evidence in the absence of any information to the c o n t r a r y . the examples about birds being able to f l y are of t h i s type. if we know that tweety is a bird  that gives us some evidence that tweety can f l y   but it is not conclusive. in the absence of i n f o r m a t i o n to the c o n t r a r y   however  we are w i l l i n g to go ahead and make the assumption that tweety can f l y . now even before we do any d e t a i l e d analysis of nonmonotonic l o g i c   we can see that there w i l l be problems in i n t e r p r e t i n g it as a model of default reasoning: in the formal semantics mcdermott and doyle provide for nonmonotonic l o g i c   a l l the nonmonotonic inferences are v a l i d . default reasoning  however  is c l e a r l y not a form of v a l i d inference. 
	r. moore 	1 
       consider the b e l i e f that l i e s behind our w i l l i n g n e s s to i n f e r that tweety can f l y from the f a c t that tweety is a b i r d . it is probably something l i k e most birds can f l y   or almost a l l birds can f l y   or a t y p i c a l b i r d can f l y . to model t h i s kind of reasoning  in a theory whose only axioms are  tweety is a b i r d   and  most birds can f l y     we ought to be able to i n f e r 
 nonmonotonlcally   tweety can f l y .   now if t h i s were a form of v a l i d i n f e r e n c e   the conclusion would be guaranteed to be true provided that the premises are t r u e . this is manifestly not the case. the premises of t h i s inference give us a good reason to draw the conclusion  but not the i r o n - c l a d guarantee that v a l i d i t y demands. 
　　　now reconsider mcdermott's formula that y i e l d s nonmonotonic inferences about b i r d s being able to f l y : 
 all x  bird x  	a m can-fly x   	-  can-fly x   
mcdermott suggests 	as 	a 	gloss of 	t h i s 	formula 
 most b i r d s can f l y     which would indicate that he thinks of the inferences it licenses as default inferences. but if we read m as   i s consistent  as mcdermott and doyle repeatedly t e l l us to do elsewhere  the formula a c t u a l l y says something q u i t e d i f f e r e n t :  for a l l x  if x is a b i r d and it is consistent to assert that x can f l y   then x can f l y .   since the inference rule for m is intended to convey  mp is derivable if ~p is not d e r i v a b l e   the notion of consistency mcdermott and doyle have in mind seems to be that p is consistent if ~p is not asserted. mcdermott's formula  then  says that the only birds than cannot f l y are the ones that are asserted not to f l y . if we have a theory whose only axioms are t h i s and an a s s e r t i o n to the e f f e c t than tweety is a b i r d   then the conclusion that tweety can f l y would be a v a l i d inference. that i s   if it is true that tweety is a b i r d   and it is true that only birds asserted to be unable to f l y are in fact unable to f l y   and tweety is not asserted to be unable to f l y   then it must be true that tweety can f l y . 
       this type of reasoning is not a form of d e f a u l t reasoning at a l l ; it rather seems to be more l i k e reasoning about one's own knowledge or b e l i e f . hence  we w i l l r e f e r to it as autoeplstemlc reasoning. autoeplstemlc reasoning  while d i f f e r e n t from d e f a u l t reasoning  is an important form of commonsense reasoning in i t s own r i g h t . consider my reason for b e l i e v i n g that i do not have an older brother. it is surely not that one of my parents once casually remarked   you know  you don't have any older b r o t h e r s     nor have i pieced it together by c a r e f u l l y s i f t i n g other evidence. i simply believe that if i d i d have an older brother i would surely know about i t   and since i d o n ' t know of any older b r o t h e r s   i must not have any. this is q u i t e d i f f e r e n t from a d e f a u l t inference based on the b e l i e f   say  that most mit graduates are oldest sons  and t h a t   since i am an mit graduate  i am probably an oldest son.

　　　default reasoning and autoepistemic reasoning are both nonmonotonic  but for different reasons. default reasoning is nonmonotonic because  to use a term from philosophy  it is defeasible. its conclusions are tentative  so  given better information  they may be withdrawn. purely autoepistemic reasoning  however  is not defeasible. if you really believe that you already know a l l the instances of birds that cannot f l y   you cannot consistently hold to that belief and at the same time accept new instances of birds that cannot fly. 
　　　autoepistemic reasoning is nonmonotonic because the meaning of an autoepistemic statement is context-sensitive; it depends on the theory in which the statement is embedded. if we have a theory whose only two axioms are 

then mp does not merely mean that p is consistent  it means that p is consistent with the nonmonotonic theory that contains only those two axioms. in this theory  we would expect canfly tweety  to be a theorem. if we change the theory by adding ~can-fly tweety  as an axiom  then we change the meaning of mp to be that p is consistent with the nonmonotonic theory that contains only the axioms 

and we would not expect can-fly tweety  to be a theorem. the operator m changes its meaning with context just as do english words such as   i      here   and  now.  the nonmonotonicity of autoepistemic theories should therefore be no more puzzling than the fact that  i am hungry  can be true when uttered by a particular speaker at a particular time  but false when uttered by a different speaker at the same time or the same speaker at a different time. so we might say that autoepistemic reasoning is nonmonotonic because it is indexical. 
	i l l 	the formalization of autoepistemic logic 
　　　rather than try directly to analyze mcdermott and doyle's nonmonotonic logic as a model of autoepistemic reasoning  we w i l l f i r s t define a logic that we can show does capture what we want to model about autoepistemic reasoning and then compare nonmonotonic logic to that. we w i l l call our logic  naturally enough  autoepistemic logic. the language w i l l be much like mcdermott and doyle's  an ordinary logical language augmented by autoepistemic modal operators. mcdermott and doyle treat consistency as their fundamental notion  so they take m as the basic modal operator and define its dual l to be ~m~. our logic w i l l be based on the notion of belief  so we w i l l take l to mean  is believed   treat it as primitive  and define m as ~l~. in any case  this gives us the same notion of consistency as theirs: a formula is consistent if its negation is not believed. there are some problems about the meaning of quantifying into the scope of an autoepistemic operator that are not relevant to the main point of this paper  so we w i l l limit our attention to propositional autoepistemic logic. 
　　　autoepistemic logic is intended to model the beliefs of an ideally rational agent reflecting upon his own beliefs. the primary objects of interest are sets of formulas of autoepistemic logic which are interpreted as the total beliefs of such agents. we w i l l call such a set of formulas an autoepistemic theory. the truth of an agent's beliefs  expressed as a propositional autoepistemic theory  w i l l be determined by  1  which propositional constants are true in the external world and  1  which formulas the agent believes. a formula of the form lp w i l l be true for an agent just in case p is in his set of beliefs. to formalize this  we define notions of interpretation and model as follows: 
　　　we proceed in two stages. first we define a propositional interpretation of an autoepistemic theory t to be an assignment of truth-values to the formulas of the language of t that is consistent with the usual truth-recursion for propositional logic and any arbitrary assignment of truth-values to propositional constants and formulas of the form lp. a propositional model  or simply model  of an autoepistemic theory is a propositional interpretation of t in which a l l the formulas of t are true. so the propositional interpretations and models of an autoepistemic theory are just those we would get in ordinary propositional logic by considering a l l formulas of the form lp to be propositional constants. we therefore inherit the soundness and completeness theorems of propositional logic; i.e.  a formula p is true in a l l the propositional models of an autoepistemic theory t if and only if it is a 
　　　tautological consequence of t   i . e .   derivable from t by the usual rules of propositional logic . next we define an autoepistemic interpretation of an autoepistemic theory t to be a propositional interpretation of t in which for every formula p  lp is true if and only if p is in t. an autoepistemic model of t is an autoepistemic interpretation of t in which a l l the formulas of t are true. so the autoepistemic interpretations and models of t are just the propositional models and interpretations of t that conform to the intended meaning of the modal operator l. 
　　　given this semantics for autoepistemic logic  what do we want from a notion of inference for the logic  from an eplstemologlcal perspective  the problem of inference is the problem of what set of beliefs  theorems  an agent ought to adopt on the basis of his i n i t i a l premises  axioms . since we are trying to model the beliefs of a rational agent  we want the agent's beliefs to be sound with respect to his premises: we want a guarantee 

that the beliefs are true provided that the premises are true. moreover  as an ideally rational agent  we want the agent's beliefs to be semantically complete: we want the beliefs to contain everything that the agent would be semantically justified in concluding from the assumption that his beliefs are true and the knowledge that they are his beliefs. an autoeplstemlc logic that meets these conditions can be viewed as a competence model of reflection upon one's own beliefs. like competence models generally  it assumes unbounded resources of time and memory  and is therefore not a plausible model of any finite being. it is  however  the model to which the behavior of rational agents ought to converge as their time and memory resources increase. 
　　　formally  we w i l l say an autoeplstemlc theory t is sound with respect to an i n i t i a l set of premises a if and only if every autoeplstemlc interpretation of t which is a propositional model of a is a model of t. this notion of soundness guarantees that a l l of the agent's beliefs are true whenever a l l his premises are true. given our semantic definitions  the world w i l l always be an autoeplstemlc interpretation of an autoepistemic theory t. so if a l l the formulas of t are true in every autoeplstemlc interpretation of t where a l l the formulas of a are true  it follows that if a l l the formulas in a are true in the world then a l l the formulas in t w i l l be true in the world. however  if there is an autoepistemic interpretation of t in which a l l the formulas of a are true but some formulas of t are false  if that model is the way the world actually i s   then a l l the formulas of a w i l l be true in the 
world and some formulas of t w i l l not. 
　　　our formal notion of completeness is that an autoepistemic theory t is semantically complete if and only if t contains every formula that is true in every autoepistemic model of t. if a formula p is true in every autoepistemic model of an agent's beliefs  then it must be true if a l l the agent's beliefs are true  and an ideally rational agent should be able to recognize that and infer p. on the other hand  if p is false in some autoepistemic model of the agent's beliefs  for a l l he can t e l l that model might be the way the world actually is  so he should not believe p. 
　　　the next problem is to give a syntactic characterization of the autoepistemic theories that satisfy these conditions. in a monotonic logic  the usual procedure is to define a collection of inference rules to apply to the axioms. in a nonmonotonic logic this is a 
　　　nontrivial matter. much of the technical ingenuity of mcdermott and doyle's system lies in simply coming up with a coherent notion of nonmonotonic derivability. the problem is that nonmonotonic inference rules do not yield a simple iterative notion of derivability the way monotonic inference rules do. we can view a monotonic inference process as applying the inference rules 
in a l l possible ways to the axioms  generating additional formulas to which the inference rules 
	r. moore 	1 
are applied in a l l possible ways  and so forth. since monotonlc inference rules are monotonlc  once a formula is generated at a given stage  it stays in at every subsequent stage. thus the theorems of a theory in a monotonlc system can be defined simply as a l l the formulas that get generated at any stage. the problem with attempting to follow this pattern with nonmonotonic inference rules is that we cannot reliably draw nonmonotonic inferences at any particular stage  since something inferred at a later stage may invalidate them. lacking such an iterative structure  nonmonotonic systems use nonconstructive  fixed point  definitions  which do not directly yield algorithms for enumerating the  derivable  formulas  but do define sets of formulas that respect the intent of the nonmonotonic inference rules  e.g.  in mcdermott and doyle's fixed points  mp is included whenever ~p is not included.  
　　　for our logic  it is easiest to proceed by f i r s t giving the closure conditions that we would expect the beliefs of an ideally rational agent to possess. informally  the beliefs should include whatever the agent could infer by ordinary logic  and whatever he could infer by reflecting on what he believes. to put this formally  an autoeplsteraic theory t that represents the beliefs of an ideally rational agent should satisfy the following conditions: 


1 	r. moore 
lp w i l l be in t if and only if p is in t  and ~lp w i l l be in t if and only if p is not in t. stability implies a soundness result even stronger than this  however. we can show than the truth of a stable autoepistemic theory depends only on the truth of the formulas of the theory that contain no autoepistemic operators.  we will call these  objective  formulas.  
theorem 1. if t is a stable autoepistemic theory  then any autoepistemic 
interpretation of t which is a proposltional model of the objective formulas of t is an autoepistemic model of t1. 
　　　in other words  if a l l the objective formulas in an autoepistemic theory are true  then a l l the formulas in that theory are true. given that the objective formulas of a stable autoepistemic theory determine whether the theory is true  it is not surprising that they also determine what a l l the formulas of the theory are. 
theorem 1. if two stable autoepistemic theories contain the same objective formulas  then they contain exactly the same formulas.1 
　　　finally  with these characterization theorems  we can prove that the syntactic criterion of stability captures the semantic criterion of completeness. 
theorem 1. an autoepistemic theory t is semantically complete if and only if t is stable. 
　　　by theorem 1  we know that stability of an agent's beliefs guarantees that they are semantically complete  but stability alone tells us nothing about whether they are sound with respect to his i n i t i a l premises. that is because the stability conditions say nothing about what an agent should not believe. they leave open the possibility of an agent's believing propositions that are not in any way grounded in his i n i t i a l premises. what we need to add is a constraint that the only propositions the agent believes are his i n i t i a l premises and those required by the stability conditions. to satisfy the stability conditions and include a set of premises a  an autoepistemic theory t must include a l l the tautological consequences of a  j {lp i p is in t} u { lp | p is not in t}. conversely  we w i l l say that an autoepistemic theory t is grounded in a set of premises a just in case every formula of t is included in the tautological consequences of a u {lp i p is in t} u {~lp | p is not in t}. the following theorem shows that this syntactic constraint on t and a captures the semantic notion of soundness. 
theorem 1. an autoepistemic theory t is sound with respect to an i n i t i a l set of premises a if and only if t is grounded in 
a. 
　　　we have shown  then  that the stable autoepistemic theories grounded in a set of premises a exactly characterize the possible sets of beliefs that an ideally rational agent might be expected to hold given a as his premises. we w i l l call these the stable expansions of a. notice that we say  sets   plural   because there may be 
more than one stable expansion of a given set of premises. consider {~lp -  q  ~lq -  p} as an i n i t i a l set of premises. the f i r s t formula says that  if p is not believed  then q is true  and the second says that  if q is not believed  then p is true. in any stable autoepistemic theory that includes these premises  if p is not in the theory then q w i l l be  and vice versa. but if the theory is grounded in these premises  if p is in the theory there w i l l be no basis for including q  and vice versa. so  a stable expansion of  ~lp -  q  ~lq -  p} w i l l contain either p or q  but not both. 
　　　it can also happen that there are no  stable expansions of a given set of premises. consider for instance {~lp -  p}. no stable autoepistemic theory that contains this formula can f a i l to contain p. if p were not in the theory  ~lp would have to be in the theory  but then p would be in the theory-a contradiction. on the other hand  if p is in the theory  then the theory w i l l not be grounded in the premises. so no stable autoepistemic theory can be grounded in 
{~lp -  p}. 
　　　this seemingly strange behavior is the result of the indexicality of the autoepistemic operator l. since l is interpreted relative to an entire set of beliefs  its interpretation w i l l change with the various ways of completing a set of beliefs. in each acceptable way of completing a set of beliefs  the interpretation of l w i l l change to make that set stable and grounded in the premises. sometimes  though  no matter how we try to complete a set of beliefs  the set of beliefs and the interpretation of l never coincide in a way that gives us a stable set of beliefs grounded in the premises. 
　　　this raises a question of how to view autoepistemic logic a s a logic. if we consider a set of premises a as axioms  what do we consider the theorems of a to be  if there is a unique stable expansion of a  then it is clear that we want this expansion to be the set of theorems of a. but what if there are several  or no  stable expansions of a  if we take the point of view of the agent  we have to say that there can be alternate sets of theorems  or no set of theorems of a. this may be a strange property for a logic to have  but  given our semantics  it is clear why this happens. an alternative  adopted by mcdermott and doyle with regard to their fixed points  is to take the theorems of a to be the intersection of the entire language with a l l the stable expansions of a. this gives us the formulas that are in a l l stable expansions of a if there is more than one  and it makes the theory inconsistent if there is no stable expansion of a. this  too  is reasonable  but it has a different 

i n t e r p r e t a t i o n . it represents what an outside observer would know  given only knowledge of the agent's premises and that he is an i d e a l l y r a t i o n a l agent. 
iv analysis of nonmonotonic logic 
       now we are in a p o s i t i o n to give an analysis of nonmonotonic l o g i c that w i l l e x p l a i n i t 1 p e c u l i a r i t i e s in terms of autoepistemic l o g i c . b r i e f l y   our conclusion w i l l be that the o r i g i n a l nonmonotonic l o g i c of mcdermott and doyle  is simply too weak to capture the notions they wanted  but mcdermott's  attempt to strengthen the l o g i c does so in the wrong way. 
       mcdermott and doyle's f i r s t l o g i c is very s i m i l a r to our autoepistemic l o g i c w i t h one g l a r i n g exception; they have nothing in t h e i r l o g i c corresponding to our c o n d i t i o n ii   i f p is in t  then lp is in t   . analogous to our stable expansions of a set of premises a  mcdermott and doyle define the nonmonotonic f i x e d points of a. in the p r o p o s l t l o n a l case  t h e i r d e f i n i t i o n is equivalent to the f o l l o w i n g : 
t is a f i x e d point of a j u s t in case t is the set of t a u t o l o g i c a l consequences of a u { lp | p i s not i n t } . 
our d e f i n i t i o n of a stable expansion of a  on the other hand  could be stated as: 
t is a stable expansion of a j u s t in case t is the set of t a u t o l o g i c a l consequences of a u {lp | p i s in t} u { lp i p i s not in t } . 
in nonmonotonic l o g i c   {lp i p is in t} is missing from the  base  of the f i x e d p o i n t s . this admits f i x e d points of nonmonotonic l o g i c that contain p but not lp. so  under an autoepistemic i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of l  mcdermott and doyle's agents are omniscient as to what they do not b e l i e v e   but they may know nothing as to what they do b e l i e v e . 
       this explains e s s e n t i a l l y a l l the p e c u l i a r i t i e s of mcdermott and doyle's o r i g i n a l l o g i c . for instance  they note  1  p. 1j t h a t mc does not f o l l o w from m c a d . changing the modality to l  t h i s is equivalent to saying t h a t  lp does not f o l l o w from ~l p  / q - the problem is t h a t   lacking the a b i l i t y to i n f e r lp from p  nonmonotonic l o g i c permits i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s of l more r e s t r i c t e d than simple b e l i e f . suppose we i n t e r p r e t l as   i n f e r a b l e in n or fewer steps  f o r some p a r t i c u l a r n. p might be i n f e r a b l e in e x a c t l y n steps  and p  / q in n+1. on t h i s i n t e r p r e t a t i o n ~l p  / q  would be true and  lp would be f a l s e . since t h i s i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of l is consistent w i t h the d e f i n i t i o n of a f i x e d p o i n t    lp does not f o l l o w from ~l p  / q . the other example of t h i s kind they note is that {mc   c} has a consistent f i x e d p o i n t   which amounts to saying simultaneously that p is consistent w i t h

everything asserted and that p is f a l s e . this set of premises is equivalent to { lp  p}  but t h i s would be inconsistent if lp were forced to be in every f i x e d point that contains p. 
　　　on the other hand  mcdermott and doyle consider it to be a problem that {mc -  d  ~d} has no consistent fixed point in t h e i r theory. in autoepistemic l o g i c   there are consistent stable theories that contain these premises  but none of them are grounded in the premises  so they do not characterize appropriate sets of b e l i e f s for a r a t i o n a l agent. thus  our analysis j u s t i f i e s nonmonotonic logic in t h i s case  against the i n t u i t i o n s of mcdermott and doyle. 
　　　mcdermott and doyle recognized the weakness of the o r i g i n a l formulation of nonmonotonic l o g i c   and mcdermott  has developed a group of theories that are stronger because they are based on modal l o g i c rather than c l a s s i c a l l o g i c . mcdermott's nonmonotonic modal theories a l t e r the l o g i c in two ways. f i r s t   the d e f i n i t i o n of f i x e d point is changed to be equivalent to 
t is a f i x e d point of a j u s t in case t is the set of modal consequences of a u 
{ lp i p i s not in t }   
where  modal consequence  means that p i - lp is included as an inference r u l e . second  mcdermott considers only theories that have the axioms of the modal logics t  sa  or s1 among the premises. 
	changing the 	d e f i n i t i o n 	of f i x e d 	point 	by 
i t s e l f brings mcdermott's l o g i c much closer to autoepistemic l o g i c - in p a r t i c u l a r   adlng p |-
 lp as an inference rule means that a l l modal f i x e d points of a are stable expansions of a. however  adding p i - lp as an inference rule rather than adding {lp i p is in t} to the base of t  means that not a l l stable expansions of a are modal f i x e d points of a. the d i f f e r e n c e is t h a t   in autoepistemic l o g i c   lp only has to be true to be in a set of b e l i e f s ; in mcdermott's l o g i c it must be grounded in a d e r i v a t i o n of p that does not r e l y on lp. so  in autoepistemic l o g i c there is a stable expansion of {lp -  p} that includes 
p  but in mcdermott's l o g i c there is no modal f i x e d point of {lp -  p} that includes p. it is as i f   in autoepistemic l o g i c   one can acquire the b e l i e f that p and j u s t i f y it l a t e r by the premise t h a t   if p is b e l i e v e d   then it is t r u e . in 
nonmonotonic l o g i c   however  the j u s t i f i c a t i o n of p has to precede i t s b e l i e f . from the point of view of the autoepistemic i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of l  modal nonmonotonic l o g i c is more conservative than i t has to be. 
       since we have already shown that autoepistemic l o g i c requires no s p e c i f i c axioms to capture a competence model of autoepistemic reasoning  we might wonder what purpose is served by mcdermott's second m o d i f i c a t i o n to nonmonotonic l o g i c   the a d d i t i o n of the axioms of various modal l o g i c s . the most p l a u s i b l e answer is t h a t   in a d d i t i o n to behaving in accordance w i t h the p r i n c i p l e s of autoepistemic l o g i c   an i d e a l l y 

 1 r. moore r a t i o n a l agent might w e l l be expected to know what some of those p r i n c i p l e s a r e . for instance  the modal logic t has a l l instances of the schema l p -  q  -   lp -  lq  as axioms. this says that the agent's b e l i e f s are closed under modus ponens  
which is c e r t a i n l y t r u e   so the agent might as w e l l believe i t . s1 adds the schema lp -  llp  which means t h a t   if the agent believes p  he believes that he believes l t - - c o n d i t i o n i i . s1 adds the schema ~lp -  l~lp  which means t h a t   if the agent does not believe p  he believes that he does not believe i t - c o n d i t i o n i i i . since a l l these formulas always are true for any i d e a l l y r a t i o n a l agent  it seems p l a u s i b l e to expect him to adopt them as premises. thus s1 seems to be the most p l a u s i b l e candidate of the nonmonotonic l o g i c s as a model of autoeplstemic reasoning. 
       the problem is that a l l of these logics also c o n t a i n the schema lp -  p  which means that if the agent believes p then p is t r u e   and that is 
not g e n e r a l l y true f o r i d e a l l y r a t i o n a l agents. it turns out that lp -  p w i l l always be contained in any stable autoeplstemic theory   t h a t i s   i d e a l l y r a t i o n a l agents always believe that t h e i r b e l i e f s are t r u e     but making it a premise allows b e l i e f s to be grounded that otherwise would not be. as we have seen  as a premise the lp -  p can i t s e l f be j u s t i f i c a t i o n for b e l i e v i n g p  w h i l e   as a  theorem   it must e i t h e r be derived from ~lp  in which case p is not b e l i e v e d   or from p  in 
which case p must be independently j u s t i f i e d   or from some other grounded formulas. in any case  as a premise schema  lp -  p can license any b e l i e f whatsoever in autoeplstemic l o g i c . this is not g e n e r a l l y true in modal nonmonotonic l o g i c   as we have also seen  but it is true in nonmonotonic s1. the s1 axiom schema ~lp -  l~lp embodies enough of the model theory of autoeplstemic l o g i c to allow lp to be   s e l f grounding : the schema 
~lp -  l~lp is equivalent to the schema ~l~lp -  lp  which allows lp to be j u s t i f i e d by the fact that i t s negation is not b e l i e v e d . this inference is never in danger of being f a l s i f i e d   but  from t h i s and lp -  p  we get an unwarranted j u s t i f i c a t i o n f o r b e l i e v i n g p. 
       the collapse of nonmonotonic s1 i n t o monotonic s1 immediately f o l l o w s . since lp -  p can be used to j u s t i f y b e l i e f in any formula at a l l   there are no formulas that are absent from every fixed point of s1  so there are no formulas of the form ~lp that are contained in every f i x e d p o i n t of s1; hence there are no theorems of the form ~lp in any theory based on nonmonotonic s1.   r e c a l l that the theorems are the i n t e r s e c t i o n of a l l the f i x e d p o i n t s .   since these formulas are j u s t the ones that would be produced by nonmonotonic inference  nonmonotonic s1 collapses to monotonic s1. in more informal terms  an agent who takes it as a premise that he is i n f a l l i b l e is l i a b l e to believe anything  so an outside observer can conclude nothing about what he does not b e l i e v e . 
       the r e a l problem w i t h nonmonotonic s1  t h e n   is not the s1 schema  so mcdermott's r a t h e r unmotivated suggestion to drop back to 

v conclusion 
       mcdermott and doyle recognized that t h e i r o r i g i n a l nonmonotonic l o g i c was too weak  b u t   when he t r i e d to strengthen i t   mcdermott misdiagnosed the problem. it appears t h a t   because he was t h i n k i n g of nonmonotonic l o g i c as a l o g i c of p r o v a b i l i t y rather than b e l i e f   he thought the problem was the lack of a connection between p r o v a b i l i t y and t r u t h . at one point he says  even though ~m~p  abbreviated lp  might p l a u s i b l y be expected to mean 'p is p r o v a b l e   ' there was not a c t u a l l y any r e l a t i o n between the t r u t h values of p and lp    1  p. 1     and l a t e r he acknowledges the q u e s t l o n a b l l l t y of the schema lp -  p  but says that   i t is d i f f i c u l t to v i s u a l i z e any other way of r e l a t i n g p r o v a b i l i t y and t r u t h      1  p. 1   . if one i n t e r p r e t s nonmonotonic l o g i c as a l o g i c of b e l i e f   however  there is no reason to expect any connection between the t r u t h of lp and the t r u t h of p. and  as we have seen  the r e a l problem w i t h the o r i g i n a l nonmonotonic l o g i c was that the   i f   h a l f of the semantic d e f i n i t i o n of l-lp is true if and only if l is believed-was not expressed in the l o g i c .

notes 
	in 	t h e i r informal 	e x p o s i t i o n   	mcdermott 	and 
doyle  1  pp. 1  emphasize that t h e i r n o t i o n of nonmonontonic inference is not to be taken as a form of v a l i d inference. if t h i s is the case  then t h e i r formal semantics cannot be considered to be the   r e a l   semantics of t h e i r nonmonotonic l o g i c . at best  it would provide the conditions that would have to hold for the inferences to be v a l i d   but t h i s leaves unanswered the question of what formulas of nonmonotonic logic mean.

   of course  autoepistemlc reasoning can be mixed w i t h d e f a u l t reasoning; we might believe that we know about most of the birds that cannot f l y . this could lead to defeasible autoepistemlc 
inferences  but t h e i r d e f e a s i b l l l t y would be the r e s u l t of t h e i r also being default inferences.

   condition iv w i l l   of course  also be s a t i s f i e d by an i n c o n s i s t e n t stable autoepistemlc theory  since such a theory would include a l l formulas of autoepistemlc l o g i c . 
　　space does not permit the i n c l u s i o n of of the proofs of the theorems. they are given in f u l l in elsewhere  moore  1 . 
　　this theorem implies that our autoepistemlc l o g i c does not contain any purely s e l f - r e f e r e n t i a l formulas as one finds in what are usually c a l l e d 
　　  s y n t a c t i c a l   treatments o f b e l i e f . i f   instead of a b e l i e f operator  we had a b e l i e f p r e d i c a t e   there might be a term p that denotes the formula bel p . whether bel p  is believed or not is clearly independent of any objective beliefs. the lack of such formulas is a characteristic difference between sentence-operator and predicate treatments of proposltlonal attitudes and modalities.
