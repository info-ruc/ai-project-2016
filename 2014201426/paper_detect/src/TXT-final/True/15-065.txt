: this article describes a formal semantics for the deontic concepts -- the concepts of permission and obligation - which arises naturally from the representations used in artificial intelligence systems instead of treating deontic logic as a branch of modal logic  with the standard possible worlds semantics  we first develop a language for describing actions  and we define the concepts of permission and obligation in terms of these action descriptions. using our semantic definitions  we then derive a number of intuitively plausible inferences  and we show generally that the paradoxes which are so frequently associated with deontic logic do not arise in our system* 
i introduction 
¡¡¡¡the representation of deontic concepts - the concepts of permission and obligation -- has not yet been seriously addressed in the artificial intelligence literature  but there are numerous application areas in which these concepts seem to be required. in our work on the taxman project   1     1     for example  we represent the characteristics of various kinds of stocks and bonds by describing the rules of permission and obligation which are binding  at any given time  on the corporation and its securityholders in our work on the  usufructuary  provisions of the louisiana civil code   1     just recently initiated  we have encountered a similar need for the representation of complex permissions and obligations nor are these examples confined to legal domains in the classical work on single agent planning systems  e.g.    1     the operators which change the state of the world can be interpreted as a set of  permitted  actions  but in a more realistic planning environment  with multiple agents  we would expect to see  obligatory  actions as well  and we would expect to see the actions of one agent produce modifications in the rules of permission and obligation binding upon another agent. similar observations apply to the field of computer security  see  e.g.    1     where there has been extensive debate over the appropriate  authorization mechanisms  for a community of computer users. for all of these purposes  a formalization of the concepts of permission and obligation appears to be essential 
outside of the field of artificial intelligence  there exists

an extensive literature on the deontic concepts  by logicians    1     philosophers    1     and lawyers   
¡¡  but the attempts to formalize these concepts have generally led to paradox since the 1s  deontic logic has been treated as a branch of modal logic  with the necessity' operator replaced by the obligation  operator  o. and the  possibility  operator replaced by the 
 permission  operator  p many of the theorems of modal logic turn out to be intuitively correct under this translation for example  the dual relationship between necessity and possibility becomes a dual relationship between obligation and permission  op = ~p~p. and this formula certainly seems plausible if it is false that you are permitted to do not-p  then you are obligated to do p. and vice versa the formula op   p. which is valid in any modal system with a reflexive accessibility relation between possible worlds  would not be plausible in a deontic logic  since people in the actual world do not always abide by their obligations  but it can be replaced by the more plausible formula op =  pp  which is valid as long as every possible world has some possible world accessible from it this point was first noted by kripke  in one of his original papers on possible worlds semantics . 
¡¡¡¡despite these positive results  there are several other modal formulae which seem counterintuitive in a deontic logic  and which cannot be so easily modified. for example  the formula for disjunctive permission  pp d pip v q   contradicts our ordinary understanding of what it means to grant permission to do p v q  but this formula is valid even in the weakest modal systems likewise  any formula containing an iterated operator  such as opp or pop  seems anomalous in a deontic context  and yet the various modal systems are distinguished precisely by the way in which they handle these iterated modalities. of course  it may make sense to say that you are permitted to impose a particular obligation upon someone else  or upon yourself  and we might conceivably write this as pop  but the inferences we would make about such statements do not correspond at all to the inferences which are valid in the standard possible world semantics. finally  even the dual relationship between permission and obligation seems problematical if we cast it into the form pp = ~1~p if it is false that you are obligated to do not-p  i.e.  if it is false that you are forbidden to do p  does it follow that p is permitted   stringing together all of these questionable inferences  it is not surprising that we can generate a host of  deontic paradoxes   and the literature is full of them 
for a survey  see  and  
in this paper  we will develop a formal semantics for 

1 l. mccarty permissions and obligations which seems to avoid these difficulties  and we will do so in a way which is entirely natural for an artificial intelligence system instead of representing the deontic concepts as operators applied to propositions  as in a standard modal logic  we will represent them as dyadic forms which take condition descriptions and action descriptions as their arguments the most important part of this representation is the use of action descriptions in the place of propositions instead of granting permissions and imposing obligations on the state of the world itself  we will grant permissions and impose obligations on the actions which change the state of the world this is an approach long advocated by 
castaneda   1     and pursued in various forms by von wright    1   . but to carry out this approach in full it seems necessary to establish a connection between the abstract description of an action and the concrete changes that occur in the world when the action takes place this has been a major concern of artificial intelligence research throughout its history     1     of course  and we will draw upon this earlier work in constructing our formalisms although the actions that we actually discuss in this paper are fairly simple ones  intended to highlight the principal features of the deontic representation  the action descriptions themselves can be extended to more realistic situations  in several ways we will return to this point in our concluding remarks 
ii deontic semantics 
¡¡¡¡in this section we develop a formal semantic interpretation of the deontic concepts  using a variant of the possible worlds approach our strategy proceeds in stages we start with an ordinary first-order language l and a set of states s. and we use these materials to construct a new language la in which we are able to describe actions the formulae of l1 are evaluated with respect to the states in s. as usual  but the formulae of la are evaluated with respect to sequences of states  or worlds. we thus have a way of saying that an action is  true' in  or is satisfied  by  a particular world the details of these constructions are presented in sections iia and ii.b below. now consider a state r which is situated at the junction between a  past world v and a  future  world w we assume that there exists a set p which tells us  for 
r 
each past world v  all the future worlds w which are  permitted.  working exclusively with this permitted set p   we construct three expressions which tell us whether an action at r is permitted  forbidden  or obligatory  respectively these expressions then become part of our deontic language ld the details of these constructions are presented in section iic below this is not the end of the story  however. since each deontic expression has a definite truth value at each state in s  it turns out that the language ld can be embedded within our original firstorder language l   and thus the process of linguistic construction we have outlined here becomes fully recursive this technique enables us to represent  dynamic  permissions and obligations  i.e.  permissions and obligations which change over time  without the use of iterated modalities this latter point is developed in section ii.d 
   the principal technical difficulty in this development rises in connection with the definition of  satisfaction  for the language la our initial approach is similar in spirit to the approach of harel  and rosenschein : we define a primitive action to be a relation between two states  and we define the meaning of the more complex formulae of la by a set of recursive truth definitions on arbitrary sequences of states but the ordinary notion of satisfaction in l1 which takes into account the complete state of the world at a given time  is too imprecise for our purposes here  and we will supplement it with a notion of strict satisfaction  which associates with each action in la 
a 
the specific set of changes in the world attributable to that action it turns out that this notion of strict satisfaction is absolutely essential to the construction of the deontic language ld without it  our definition of a rule of permission simply would not work we will return to this point in section iiib a. state descriptions 
     let l1 be a many-sorted function-free first-order language with equality  and let s be a set of states with respect to which the formulae of l1 are evaluated we will follow the standard procedures for specifying the syntax and the semantics of a first-order language thus  if  own x y  is a formula of l1 with free variables x and y  and if o is an assignment of the variables x and y to elements in the domain of interpretation of l1 and if own s  is the set of tuples defining the extension of the predicate own for s € s  then we will say that  own x y  is true m s under the assignment o  if and only if  ¦Ò x  o y   e own s  we will write this in general as ¦Ò & =  own x y   but if the assignment ¦Ò is fixed and clear from the context  we will often omit it from the notation and write s =  own x y  truth conditions for the nonatomic formulae of l will also be defined in the standard way if 
there are constraints in our domain of interpretation  expressible as a finite set of formulae in l1 we will simply assume that s has been restricted in advance to include only those states in which the constraints are conjunctively satisfied to avoid any mathematical complexities  however  and to reveal the points of greatest importance to the representational problems of artificial intelligence  we will also assume  whenever it is convenient to do so  that the relevant sets are finite thus we may assume that the predicate symbols are finite  that the domain of interpretation is finite  and so on we will attempt to remove these restrictions at a later date

system; and we have confined our attention so far to a relatively simple language of actions unfortunately  these two points are intimately connected the rules of inference proposed for our system are complex because they take into account the structure of the language of actions l and as we add further complexity to la we will certainly add complexity to the rules of inference  too nevertheless  we believe that the semantics of the deontic language itself  the language ld is basically correct  and robust  and that it will remain in its present form as the language la evolves perhaps this is even a fact of our cognitive lives that the concepts of permission and obligation are relatively simple  and the complexity arises instead from our concept of 
action
