 
we argue that a . i . should not lose sight of the need for general principles when working with problems in specific domains. we also argue the case for studying a r t i f i c i a l learning. we present a computer program with a very l i m i t e d sense modality that acquires some f a c i l i t y with the english language and learns some numerical concepts. the principles by which such learning takes place are expressed in terms of a concept of process and they prove to be applicable to learning the decimal numeral system and forming elementary utterances as well as learning to interpret english sentences. 
	1. 	introduction 
being convinced of the central importance of learning in i n t e l l i g e n t behaviour and believing that r e a l l y complex  performance  programs w i l l be exceedingly d i f f i c u l t to write and even harder to extend by any other means  we have been addressing the problem of a r t i f i c i a l learning   a . l .   . the term   a r t i f i c i a l   is intended to carry connotations similar to those in   a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e   . the investigation is to be informed by what we think we know about natural i n t e l l i g e n c e and i t s development but the computer program which is one of the products of the study w i l l depart from the psychological paradigm whenever this is expedient. 
the two a l t e r n a t i v e approaches to a.l. that we have considered are to increment a performing system that already embodies some knowledge s p e c i f i c a l l y relevant to the material being learned or  on the other hand  to set up a program endowed with the minimum of sensori-motor capability and the s k i l l s needed for expansion. since the incremented program must possess such s k i l l s in any case  the naive e n t i t y is inherently simpler to b u i l d . what 
is more  it becomes in time a performing system that can be incremented  thus subsuming the a l t e r n a t i v e approach. 
the lesson that a . i . has learned since 1  1  is that f r u i t f u l research is most l i k e l y by considering specific domains in d e t a i l . this point of view is elaborated by minsky and papert  1 . that does not mean  however  that we should abandon altogether the search for general p r i n c i p l e s   only that success is more l i k e l y by generalising from some thoroughly worked p a r t i c u l a r examples. the need for genera l i t y is p a r t i c u l a r l y obvious in learning  since a system that learns only a few well-chosen things may be s u p e r f i c i a l l y less impressive that a well w r i t t e n performance program. the methods employed by the learning program must  as far as possible  be made 
non-specific to the examples chosen. our approach d i f f e r s from some  e.g.  1   especially in that our program is not given express goals to which a plan can be related l o g i c a l l y . such would be inappro-
p r i a t e to a naive e n t i t y  apart from general goals l i k e  associate symbol with meaning  or  carry out imperatives  which are i m p l i c i t   . rather it reacts to i t s environment  including feedback from i t s own actions  laying down patterns of behaviour for future use and r e t r i e v i n g them according to a suitably abstracted representation of what was perceived. the l a t t e r is normally a part of the pattern of behaviour. 
the aspects of i n t e l l i g e n c e which are examined in the present work involve a dialogue conducted in english and also some numerical concepts. 	the program acquires both semantic and syntactic knowledge of some words  which it subsequently uses and  comprehends . 	it also acquires the meanings of the numerals in the decimal arabic system  using the same basic repertoire of a b i l i t i e s even though 
numerals are not conventionally considered to be part of a natural language. 
the domain in which these a c t i v i t i e s take place has been selected for the utmost technical s i n p l i c i t y . the program reads from and writes to a teletypewriter where a person is s i t t i n g . the dialogue is concerned with p r i n t i n g characters  including l e t t e r s that make up words and sentences. so it is also possible to discuss what is being said; no unnatural separation arises between speech and other a c t i v i t i e s . 
beginning with no vocabulary and only the general a b i l i t i e s described in section 1 below  the program acquires s u f f i c i e n t knowledge to engage in a 
dialogue of which the following is an annotated sample. the convention is that lines entered by the human tutor are preceded by a colon; the others are produced by the program. : print three asterisks and a dot 
* * * . 
: what did you print before you printed a dot 
	three asterisk 	 cf. 	 1   
: what did you say 
three asterisk 
 : say triple after i print three characters the word   t r i p l e   is new to the program.   a f t e r   is l i k e  when  in t h i s context but in the domain in use there is no simultaneity or ambiguous temporal proximity and so   a f t e r   is more appropriate. a kind of  demon  has been set up to await the specified condition. these demons are not triggered by goals like those of papert  1  but by events as they can be characterised in the program's representation. i f   l a t e r   we enter a group of three characters  the desired result occurs. 
triple 
the program learns the rudiments of the decimal number system so that it can do a d d i t i o n   subt r a c t i o n and m u l t i p l i c a t i o n with two-place numerals  
: what are 1s 
1 
the matter is discussed b r i e f l y in section 1 . before that we describe the p r i n c i p l e s on which t h i s work is based and then present a dialogue demonstrating a complete learning sequence. 	at the 

1 

time of w r i t i n g   the program to carry out this dialogue has been checked by hand and is being computer-tested. 
the p r i n c i p l e s by which the program lays down patterns of behaviour can be expressed in terms of process and some p r i m i t i v e operations on procedures. it is to be hoped that they w i l l prove to be applicable or extendable to domains other than the simple teletypewriter s i t u a t i o n . 
1. principles 
we begin by distinguishing between a procedure and a process  one of the d i s t i n c t i o n s drawn by newell  1   and use these concepts to define constructs of memory. after that we show how these are used to discern patterns of r e p e t i t i o n in events and to associate words and other symbols with t h e i r meanings in a constructive way. 
1 processes and procedures 
a procedure consists of a sequence of instructions in a t e x t . we allow the text of a procedure to be examined and modified by other procedures and for this reason the text is maintained in the form of a l i s t   an idea due to newell and simon  1 . procedures can c a l l other procedures either by r e f e r r i n g in a c a l l i n s t r u c t i o n to a variable that contains a procedure or by r e f e r r i n g in such an i n s t r u c t i o n d i r e c t l y to a procedure  using an address p o i n t e r   . in the l a t t e r case  we term the called procedure a subroutine constant. we apply the same term to any procedure that is d i r e c t l y addressed by another  whether it is called   i   e   executed  or not. 
a process is the execution of one or more procedures. the programming system  1  builds a data structure to control a process. 	the execution of a 
procedure is governed by an a c t i v a t i o n record which points to the procedure and to the next i n s t r u c t i o n to be executed. it also contains space for the contents of i t s variables and points to the a c t i vation record for the process that invoked i t . f i n a l l y   it contains provision for non-local variables.  dynamic binding  as in lisp  1  is the d e f a u l t .   
we want to be able to do several things with processes and the most important is to save them for l a t e r use. 	this happens to the c a l l e r whenprocedure is in execution and to link back along the chain of invocation 
from the current process  the e n t i r e state of the program can be ascertained. the structure i n t o 
which a l l the processes are woven is called the run 
time 	s t r u c t u r e . 
1 short-term memory 
the run time structure is the store for the f i r s t of our two memory constructs: short-term memory  s.t.m. . it holds the run time structure for the few most recent events  discarding the e a r l i e s t by the c r i t e r i a of storage space and search time. this seems preferable to l i f t i n g something a r b i t r a r i l y out of psychological theory as  for instance  regulating i t s size according to m i l l e r ' s celebrated  magic number 1 +  1   1 . 
the crucial question to ask of a memory is not what is stored or how  but how it is r e t r i e v e d . retrieval keys are procedural t e x t ; 	when presented with a procedure  the stm interface w i l l search the 
run time structure for a match to i t . a l l processes  including those referenced only by variables  are included. their execution procedures and their v a r i a b l e s ' contents are included as are a l l subroutine constants. since the stm is of limited s i z e   e f f i c i e n t performance is not a fundamental problem although it would obviously be nice to have some sort of contentaddressable memory device. 
four types of match are allowed when r e t r i e v i n g from the memory  i exact l i n e for line equivalence. 
ii the argument i s found completely w i t h i n a procedure: the parts preceding and f o l l o w i n g 
the common portion are supplied with the r e s u l t . 
iii exact match apart from a d i f f e r i n g subroutine constant in corresponding p o s i t i o n : this is indicated with the r e s u l t . 
iv any of the above i - i i i w i t h a subroutine constant of a procedure. 
the result of i is a reference to a process   i . e . a variable name or execution i n d i c a t o r and an a c t i v a t i o n record . in the other  more complex  cases results are chained together and always conclude with a process reference. 
no problem arises with establishing the equivalence of d i f f e r e n t variable names during comparisons 

ever one procedure c a l l s another but it can also because in t h i s work a l l the procedures used against happen on other occasions. if during a process stm are synthesised by the program and obey 
some v i t a l piece of information is missing  	that 	suitable 	conventions. 
process can be suspended u n t i l the information is found. this idea i s used for storing the meanings the normal event when i n t e r p r e t i n g a word is for an 
of words: 	when a new word is encountered a 	operation on stm to take place y i e l d i n g a result 
procedure is synthesised and called - that process which can then be made available for others to use then suspends i t s e l f to wait u n t i l the word occurs by leaving it in the run time structure in an 
again. 	execution of a special procedure named result. 	a 
                                                                   common noun l i k e   d o t   i n i t i a t e s an stm search w i t h something that can be done with both processes and 	argument  .  and passes the result which can be any procedures is to activate them. 	but when it comes 	of the p o s s i b i l i t i e s i-iv. 	we often w r i t e pro-
to inspecting them they are quite d i s t i n c t . a cedures in square parentheses and always omit process contains procedures as well as other p r i n t instructions for easier reading. more processes; procedures do not contain processes. elaborate words and morphemes generally expect a process may be accessed and modified; the value results of these various types  as well as y i e l d i n g of i t s variables can be obtained and updated using further ones in t u r n ; t h e i r expectations are a p r i m i t i v e value. these variables may refer to conditioned by the circumstances p r e v a i l i n g at the procedures and processes. the activation record time they were i n i t i a l l y acquired or subsequently for the process may be accessed to discover which modified.

the following is an i l l u s t r a t i o n . 
: * an asterisk and a comma 
the phrase  an a s t e r i s k   locates  *  w i t h i n t *   l . this is a type ii match and the result is a reference to the procedure  *   showing that      
was the part following the common p o r t i o n . 
suppose that the conjunctive p a r t i c l e  and  is a new word to the program at this p o i n t . the procedure for handling new words  known as newentity  is called and it sets up code for  and  in future that w i l l expect a type ii result of this sort from the l e f t . i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of  a comma  yields as result a reference to the variable containing     w i t h i n the current process  for   a n d     i t s e l f and again code to v e r i f y this in future is incorporated i n t o  and . the v e r i f i -
cation is constructive  which means that in a similar phrase in future  *   w i l l be re-assembled by  and . this step is essential to make imperatives possible. 
a word can impose r e s t r i c t i o n s on the processes it w i l l accept from an stm look-up. for instance  the morpheme   - e d     once it has been acquired  i n s i s t s on a process p r i o r to the present time.   a f t e r   demands a similar relationship between the two processes referred to by the two clauses in the sentence. apart from specifying i t s relationship to other processes  one can also assert that the 
process found must be the execution of a given procedure and that the matching procedure must be in a p a r t i c u l a r v a r i a b l e . 
1 grammar and the result mechanism 
before enumerating the possible combinations of occurrence and expectation we must discuss the result mechanism and i t s purpose. the input stream is being scanned l i n e a r l y   l e f t to r i g h t   see section 1   j u s t as human speech is also onedimensional in substance. grammar imposes a second dimension so that a sentence is segmented into units of lesser rank  1 . the embodiment of this phenomenon in our program is the a b i l i t y of some word-processes to require  by means of a seek  to i n t e r p r e t the following words in the sentence before giving t h e i r results and of other wordprocesses to take results from the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n j u s t conducted on t h e i r l e f t  with the option of closing an outstanding seek . 
as an example consider the sentence:  a dot is what you p r i n t e d .   the i n d e f i n i t e a r t i c l e seeks the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of i t s d i r e c t object  the following 
word.  dot  w i l l search stm and give a r e s u l t   the d e t a i l s of which depend on whether and how  .  can be found. the verb  to be  in the t h i r d person looks for a result on the l e f t and  expecting a procedure  w i l l extract  .1 from whatever form the result may take.   i s   also requires a result from the r i g h t   the complement  and seeks accordingly. 
the complement is the clause  what you p r i n t e d   . each of these words seeks to the r i g h t   specifying c e r t a i n a t t r i b u t e s  or none  of the process to be located in stm. the last word  although it looks for one  has no direct object. so the v e r i f y i n g 
stm c a l l that it contains becomes  by d e f a u l t   a 
search for the example of p r i n t i n g most recently 
referred to which w i l l   if the statement is true  
be found f i r s t . this is because it w i l l already 
have been referenced during the processing for 
 dot . 
in an example such as  1 and a   1 w i l l seek for a 
direct object in case a noun  e.g.   d o t s     is f o l l o w i n g .  and  demands a result from the l e f t and so causes the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of 1 to continue without an object  thus giving the answer  ♀♀♀ . 
 this is a case of closing an outstanding seek.  
during i n t e r p r e t a t i o n a word w i l l expect either one or two r e s u l t s   depending on how many it received i n i t i a l l y . words that expect only one are s i m i l a r 
whether that one comes from the right or the l e f t . if case i   r e f e r r i n g to section 1  is expected  process-type conditions w i l l be asserted and v e r i f i e d with no result being passed on if they are not s a t i s f i e d . in the other cases  s p e c i f i c procedures  e.g.  call   1; copy  for  two   w i l l be expected in the proper textual relationships and if these are not forthcoming and a renewed scan of stm f a i l s to realise them  a resolving routine is c a l l e d . another such routine is called if there is no result at a l l when one is expected. 
a l i t t l e more is said about them in section 1. 
at the present time  processes that expect two results must take one from each side although we hope to l i f t that r e s t r i c t i o n l a t e r . the l e f t hand result can be any of the usual cases i-iv. 
on the r i g h t   however  it must be a process  possibly the current process  since only then can any kind of r e l a t i o n s h i p be established between l e f t and r i g h t . for example  in :  a dot is a character   the word   i s   w i l l extract from the l e f t the procedure  .  and  character  w i l l f i n d it during i t s stm look-up  returning as r e s u l t a reference to the process for   i s   i t s e l f . if a 
procedure is expected on the l e f t   one w i l l always be extracted from any of the cases i-iv. if no result appears  a resolving routine is c a l l e d . it is also called if either of the expected processes does not m a t e r i a l i s e   whether or not a procedure has occurred instead. 
1 long-term memory 
we turn now to the second memory construct which  not s u r p r i s i n g l y   is called long-term memory  l.t.m. . we are not concerned here with a h i s t o r i c a l record of events from which a verbal account might be constructed but w i t h something much more p r i m i t i v e for the purpose of recognising what has previously been seen and for acting out patterns of behaviour that have been l a i d down by experience. 
the basis of matching in ltm is also on procedural t e x t . 	the store contains a set of suspended 
processes  each waiting for the occurrence of a p a r t i c u l a r procedure. the most common example is that of a process for i n t e r p r e t i n g a word w a i t i n g 
for the occurrence of that word  in procedural form ＊ 
one conceivable convention for r e t r i e v i n g and a c t i v a t i n g a process in ltm is to make it automatic upon the appearance of a matching procedure in the run time s t r u c t u r e . a more convenient method  and the one adopted here  is e x p l i c i t l y to drive ltm r e t r i e v a l at strategic times by d i r e c t i n g it to match exhaustively every part of a procedure referred to in a p a r t i c u l a r process. the p r i n c i p a l application is the analysis of input   i . e . sensory data  which proceeds in this fashion. the more general scheme could be implemented simply by applying this drive-ltm p r i m i t i v e every time a procedure is synthesised. 

1 

by observing a l e f t to r i g h t   and for subroutine constants top down  d i s c i p l i n e in d r i v i n g   a straightforward indexing scheme in ltm is possible. in this convention  the record retrieved on each occasion is the one whose key has the longest match w i t h the left-hand end of the source procedure  a f t e r which the source is truncated and recursion takes place u n t i l it is exhausted. 
1 perceiving patterns 
the program refers to ltm in order to segment data  presented through the t e l e t y p e w r i t e r   i n t o f a m i l i a r u n i t s   t y p i c a l l y words or other symbols and those characters treated as objects because of past association  e.g.   *     . this is b a s i c a l l y the process of d r i v i n g ltm but for convenience the r e t r i e v a l and a c t i v a t i o n stages have been separated  at least for the time being. before it is possible to refer to ltm the program converts the data into the form of a procedure for p r i n t i n g i t . 
as the segmentation of data takes place  stm is used in order to detect any r e p e t i t i o n that may be present. if the e n t i t y currently being s c r u t i nised has occurred e a r l i e r in the data stream  the program hypothesises that the items intervening between the present and the most recent occurrence are about to recur and tests the hypothesis on as many subsequent items as it w i l l obtain. 
this process of recognition we c a l l procedural abstraction because the end product is a h i e r a r c h i c a l l y structured procedure that w i l l t e x t u a l l y r e create the o r i g i n a l . for example  the procedural abstraction f o r  dot  is  add idot    where add is the p r i m i t i v e for appending a procedure to the one that is currently being synthesised and   dot}  represents a subroutine constant that would  if it were executed  p r i n t the word  dot . add is one of a number of p r i m i t i v e s introduced in  1 . when a r e p e t i t i o n is detected  the unit to be repeated is placed as a subroutine constant in a procedure that w i l l c a l l it and copy the result the correct number of times. for instance    * * *   w i l l be represented as  call cadd  *  j; copy; copy  where copy is defined in terms of add; a few t e c h n i c a l i t i e s have been omitted. this procedure ia now in a convenient form to be verbalised as  three asterisk  by methods shortly to be described. 

it might be verbalised:  two asterisks and three commas three times  although such an utterance would be beyond the capacity of this program to w r i t e  as well as being ambiguous . 
once an abstraction has been made from a line of input  it is used to drive ltm. the associated processes are retrieved from ltm and activated. the reason for using the abstracted version rather than the raw input is to allow patterns to be perceived and interpreted as such  so that   . . .   ia immediately seen as  three dots  rather than as 
 dot dot dot . 	in some languages  the p l u r a l is 
formed by repeating the noun; our program readily copes with that form by using the abstraction principle. 
1 stm-ltm complementarity 
there is an interesting and perhaps surprising complementarity between the two memory constructs. invoking the stm interface involves searching the near past. a process that calls the ltm interface is suspended and stored until the specified procedural argument occurs. thus when ltm is invoked it is effectively the future that is being searched. 
the two interfaces are uniform so that they can be interchanged in a procedure. this fact is used to great advantage in the present work where a 
process waiting in ltm for a word and then looking up its meaning in stm can use the same procedure as the one that waits in ltm for the meaning to look up the word in stm. this means that extending the meaning of a word in comprehension w i l l automatically extend its meaning in utterance because the same principles govern the interpretation of objects that are not synbols as govern those that are. the examples of patterns given in section 1 can be used to drive ltm just as words can. indeed  often both are mixed within one line. 
we can explain more fully by considering the example of the numeral 1. to begin with  it is associated with     . that means that a procedure was created and initiated. the process then saved itself in ltm with the key     1     . note that the ltm and stm arguments are called key and signature  respectively. when 1 is encountered  that process is restarted and it searches stm with signature   ff  . the same procedure with its variables reassigned is waiting with key   ♀♀   and signature     i t is written in a recursive loop to make both processes possible . now it is taught that 1 can also qualify a noun as i n :  **1 asterisks . the program appends a more complex procedure that includes a seek and has the signature  call   ; copy . this addition necessitates the creating of one more process in ltm with this as key and     1     as signature. then the program could reply:  1 dot  to a question such as:  what did you print  . 
for this purpose  the procedure must include code to expect results  e.g. the word  dots   and put  1  in front of i t . this code complements the seek in the version where  1  is the key. there are  in fact  general rules for deriving such complementary code although they w i l l not be given here. it is arranged so that in each case the complementary code is not executed.  the appended procedure recurses to the original procedure for this purpose.  
1 how procedures are extended 
in section 1 we referred to the necessity for resolving routines. if a word is expecting to be passed a process reference from the adjacent phrase and the result it receives is procedural that means that some information in that procedure has not been explained and a word must be modified to take account of i t . except where the receiving word is two-sided  it is the sending word that must be 
extended. a procedure known as resolve sets up a conditional call in the word-procedure to some new

code which is composed along s i m i l a r l i n e s to the i n i t i a l syntheses performed by newentity   m e n t i o n e d i n s e c t i o n 1 . 1   . 
the second r e s o l v i n g r o u t i n e   known as xresolve   x f o r c o n t r a d i c t i o n   is c a l l e d when an stm l o o k up f a i l s . xresolve ends up d o i n g the same as resolve i f i t i s unable t o use i t s own s p e c i a l i t i e s which are a s f o l l o w s . very o f t e n   the procedure t h a t has c a l l e d xresolve w i l l c o n t a i n a s u b r o u t i n e c o n s t a n t   known as the s i g n a t u r e   t h a t is the b a s i c meaning of the w o r d . e.g. the s i g n a t u r e o f   d o t   i s   .   . one course o f a c t i o n is to a l l o w xresolve to c r e a t e another procedure

there are cases where a process r e s u l t may have some a t t r i b u t e s d i f f e r e n t from those expected by a word. an i n t e r e s t i n g case a r i s e s when a pending process   i m p e r a t i v e   is r e c e i v e d by a word expect i n g the e x e c u t i o n of another  s p e c i f ic   procedure . then it is taken to r e f e r to the f u t u r e and the r e c e i v i n g process suspends i t s e l f by c a l l i n g ltm w i t h the i m p e r a t i v e procedure as k e y . thus if the human t u t o r types i n :   i p r i n t a n a s t e r i s k     e . g . i n :  do something a f t e r i . . .     then the pronoun   i   d i c t a t e s t h a t the match must b e found in a r e a d i n g process and t h a t p r o v i s o is i n c o n s i s t e n t w i t h a n i m p e r a t i v e i n t e r p r e t a t i o n . s o i t w a i t s u n t i l the procedure does t u r n up d u r i n g a r e a d .

when the u n f a m i l i a r  asterisk  is encountered  a procedure is eynthesised that w i l l be a c t i v a t e d 
when the word is encountered again. 	this procedure is also associated w i t h   *   and there are two corresponding processes w a i t i n g in ltm  both of 
which share t h i s procedure. 
in the next set of examples  the verbs   t o p r i n t   and   t o say  w i l l be introduced in the i m p e r a t i v e   using the device of i n d i c a t i n g the appropriate a c t i o n in square parentheses. the procedure so supplied is executed in a process that has the a t t r i b u t e s of the imperative o u t l i n e d in section 1. we continue w i t h the regular past tense morpheme   - e d     the strong form   s a i d     and the personal pronouns  you  and   i   .

:i printed an asterisk 
the personal pronoun   i   adapts the expectation set up by   p r i n t e d   to v e r i f y that the a s t e r i s k was r e f e r r e d to by a reading process instead of having been executed. an a l t e r n a t i v e method of i n d i c a t i n g the past imperfect tense in english is to use the a u x i l i a r y verb   t o do .

imperatives and the present tense frequently r e l a t e to future events and   a f t e r   can work on procedures to be executed j u s t as it does on those already used in the past. 	for example: 
:print a dot after you print an asterisk 
if the condition in the subordinate clause depends  on an external event then the program must wait for it to happen and t h i s is the case in the section 1

next we deal with the verb   t o be  in the t h i r d person singular of the present tense and w i t h the pronoun  what  both as a r e l a t i v e and an i n t e r r o gative pronoun. if we begin by teaching a class word then some reasonable   i s   statements can be made. 

after   *      character  is taken as synonymous w i t h   a s t e r i s k   but subsequently the assumption is v i o l a t e d . the common a t t r i b u t e   i . e . printed or p r i n t a b l e   is extracted and associated with the word. now we introduce   i s   .

in the f i n a l part of t h i s dialogue  numbers and numerals are taught. to begin w i t h   the program must be acquainted w i t h  two-ness   i . e . it must 
encounter two of something  before it can associate words with i t . it immediately recognises r e p e t i t i o n and structures i t s procedural representation h i e r a r c h i c a l l y to r e f l e c t the pattern n a t u r a l l y . after the i n i t i a l instance of two of something  it can learn the p l u r a l morpheme   - s   and some numbers. 

the sequence given for learning the p l u r a l morpheme is optimal but the processing  using xresolve  is quite robust and an a r b i t r a r y sequence of examples which includes these in various orders w i l l eventually lead to the correct synthesis. at the stage of four objects  the resolving procedure notices that the procedure it is appendirg to is textually equal to the new procedure and so it puts in a recursive c a l l instead. that takes care of a l l cases  of course. 
for large numbers the best approach is to use numerals. a method suggested by the use in infant education of blocks that c l i p together is to associate the numerals with character strings of appropri ate length.

:♀♀ 1 
 we continue thus up to and including 1  which is learned as an e n t i t y and not understood as a true decimal number. simple addition and subtraction can now be taught. 
the program can also learn to understand the numerals in the 1ame syntactic role as the verbal numbers. because the r e p e t i t i o n in  ♀♀♀   the meaning of 1  has been separated in a h i e r a r c h i cally structured procedure from the root   e     the same p a t t e r n   in e.g.   * * *     can be recognised and the meaning of 1 generalised to apply the r e p e t i t i o n to  ♀  only when there is no d i r e c t object.

this has provided a road to m u l t i p l i c a t i o n .  we could easily have taught   a r e     the p l u r a l of   i s   as w e l l : e.g.  dots and commas are characters .  the word  times  could have been used if p r e f e r r e d . 
we begin teaching the significance of p o s i t i o n in decimal numbers by showing that the presence of zero just a f t e r a numeral means that the number is applied to ten instead of to one. 
:two 1s are 1 
:three 1s are 1 
this continues up to and including 1. another complete set of examples must be given to show that any following numeral and not only zero has this e f f e c t . typical of these examples are the f o l l o w i n g . 
:three 1s and 1 are 1 
:three 1s and 1 are 1 
this is s u f f i c i e n t for any number from 1 to 1 to be understood. 
now two-place arithmetic can be done. the n o t a t ion i t s e l f now carries the program with it for 
many place numbers. the program is very simpleminded in i t s i n t e r p r e t a t i o n   though. numbers l i k e 1 are expanded out to a s t r i n g of that length. teaching it the algorithms for a r i t h -
metic in columns would be the next step. 	that p a r t i c u l a r problem has already been tackled by badre 	 1  although his approach is not that of learning ab i n i t i o that is taken here. 
there i s   of course  a level of abstraction at which the individual takes account of the procedures for i n t e r p r e t i n g the meanings of large numbers without actually executing them; the symbolism then becomes the vehicle for higher thought. a possible d i r e c t i o n for future research is to f i n d out whether the p r i n c i p l e s described in the present work would apply also to these more complex procedures.
