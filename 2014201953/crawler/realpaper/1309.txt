John  did  not  realize  that  Mary  stayed  home. 

Asserting  (9)  or  (9a)  requires  the  speaker  to  pre(cid:173)
suppose  the  t r u th  of  (10), 

(10)  Mary  stayed  home. 

It  should  be  clear  now  what  is  meant  by  a  counter-
f a c t i ve  verb.  An  example  of  a  counterfactive  verb  is 
pretend. 

It  appears  worthwhile  exploring  in  some  d e t a il 

implementations  of  these  constructions  in  the  t a c - t a c-
toe  game  playing  s e t t i ng  of  Davies  and  Isard  (1972). 
Admittedly,  many  of  these  constructions  receive  s t e r i le 
interpretations  in  t h is  context,  but  many  others, 
gether  w i th  the  modal  constructions  of  Davies  and 
I s a r d,  raise  some  i n t e r e s t i ng  problems  concerning  t h e ir 
implementati on. 

t o(cid:173)

We  w i ll  i l l u s t r a te  these  problems  by  several 
examples  and  t ry  to  draw  some  general  conclusions 
about  implementation  of  these  constructions  in  the  type 
of  settings  mentioned  above. 

3.  Modal  t i c - t a c - t oe  of  Davies  and  Isard 

and  the  semantics  of some pc-verbs: 

3.1  Davies  and  Isard  (1972)  have  chosen  the 

s e t t i ng  of  a  game  of  t i c - t a c - t oe  in  order  to  explore 
the  semantics  of  modal  verbs  (might,  can,  w i l l,  e t c .) 
and  hypotheticals  ( if  you  had  ........).  This  is  a  simple 
enough,  yet  n o n t r i v i a l,  s e t t i n g. 
It  provides  them  a 
universe  of  discourse  in  which  they  can  discuss  the 
notion  of  possible  courses  of  events  —  what  might 
happen  in  the  future  as  w e ll  as  what  might  have 
happened,  but  d id  not. 
toe  against  a  human  opponent  and  can  answer  questions 
about  the  course  of  the  game. 

Their  program  plays  t i c - t a c-

We  w i ll  use  t h is  setting  to  explore  the  semantics 
In  p a r t i c u l a r,  we  w i ll  be  interested 

of  some  pc-verbs. 
in  constructions  in  which  both  a  modal  and  a  pc-verb 
occur.  Some  pc-verbs  w i ll  require  consideration  of  the 
possible  courses  of  events  even  without  the  presence  of 
a  modal  verb. 

There  appear  to  be  at  l e a st  four  d i f f e r e nt  factors 
we  have  to  consider.  These  are  as  follows. 
(Let  R  and 
M  denote  the  human  opponent  and  the  machine  respective(cid:173)
l y .) 

A. 

Instead  of  j u st  one  possible  course  of  events, 

we  w i ll  be  concerned  w i th  a  set  or  sets  of  possible 
courses  of  events.

C,  Whether  or  not  certain  presuppositions  hold 

has  to  be  checked  by  M  not  only  with  respect  to  one 
possible  course  of  events  but  also  w i th  respect  to  a 
set  of  possible  courses  of  events. 

D.  M  has  to  deal  w i th  possible  courses  of  events 

because  M  has  to  act  as  if  i ts  own  goal  is  changed. 

It  was  not  clear  from  Davies  and  Isard  (1972) 

whether  a ll  these  factors  were  considered  by  them.  A 
referee  has  pointed  out  to  us  that  t h e ir  program  does 
cope  to  some  extent  w i th  these  factors. 

3.2  We  s h a ll  see  the  effect  of  these  factors  in  a 

nissber  of  example  s i t u a t i o n s. 

N o t a t i o n:  H:  human  opponent;  Mt  machine;  m,n  . . .:

squares  are  numbered  1,  2,  3  . , .,  9  from  l e ft  to  r i g ht 
and  from  top  to  bottom.  Y,  Z:.  number  of  move;  Y  w i ll 
range  over  M's  moves  and  Z  over  H's  moves. 

prevent  (not  in  the  sense  of  forbid) 

(negatlve-if  verb): 

(1)  H:  Could  I  have  prevented  you  from  taking 

m  on  the  Yth  move? 

In  order  to  answer  a f f i r m a t i v e l y,  M  has  to  check 

that  there  is  at  l e a st  one  possible  course  of  events  up 
to  the  ( Y - l ) th  move  such  that  if  t h is  course  of  events 
had  actually  occurred  it  would  not  have  been  wise  for  M 
to  take  m  on  the  Yth  move.  Thus  M  is  required  to  con(cid:173)
struct  a  set  of  possible  courses  of  events  and  check 
whether  at  least  one  of  them  s a t i s f i es  a  certain 
property. 

M  also  has  to  check  the  presupposition  that  the 

actual  course  of  events  was  such  that  indeed  on  the  Yth 
move  M  took  m;  otherwise  the  question  about  preventing 
M  does  not  a r i s e.  The  presuppositions  of  prevent  are 
not  always  completely  clear.  For  example,  consider 
"Not  only  could  I  have  prevented  you  from  winning, 
I 
could  even  have  prevented  you  from  drawing  the  game." 
There  appears  to  be  no  presupposition  for  the  second 
prevent. 
course,  here  we  have  a  composition  of  prevent  and  not 
only  -  but  also. 
s i t i on  of  two  pc-verbs  or  a  pc-verb  and  a  connective, 
the  presuppositions  become  less  obvious.  We  w i ll  come 
across  t h is  phenomenon  several  times  in  the  f o l l o w i n g. 

(This  example  is  due  to  a  referee.)  Of 

In  general,  whenever  we  have  a  compo(cid:173)

(2)  H:  On  the  Zth  move,  could  I  have  prevented 

you  from  winning? 

M  has  to  s t a rt  w i th  the  actual  state  of  a f f a i rs  as 
of  the  ( Z - l ) th  move  and  check  whether,  on  the  Zth  move, 
there  was  a  nonlosing  strategy  for  H.  A l t e r n a t i v e l y, 
it  has  to  check  whether,  f or  any  Zth  move  of  H,  M  has  a 
winning  strategy. 
otherwise, 

the  reply  is  a f f i r m a t i v e;

it 

Again  we  see  that  M  has  to  v e r i fy  a  certain  proper(cid:173)

ty  for  a  set  of  possible  courses  of  events  rather  than 
a  specified  course  of  events. 

B.  M  w i ll  be  concerned  w i th  possible  courses  of 
events  not  only  w i th  respect  to  i ts  own  play  but  also 

The  presupposition  here  is  that  M  did  w i n;  other(cid:173)

wise,  the  question  of  preventing  M  from  winning  is 

353 

unnatural.  Again  if  we  have  a  composition  such  as  " It 
was  s t i ll  possible  f or  you  to  win  as  l a te  as  the  6th 
move,  but  I  could  have  prevented  you  from  winning  as 
early  as  the  3rd  move",  the  presuppositions  axe  less 
obvious  (example  is  due  to  a  referee). 

We  can  also  consider  the  p o s s i b i l i ty  of  M  r e(cid:173)

f l e c t i ng  on  I ts  performance  by  asking  questions  as  in 
(2) 
to  i t s e lf  and  coning  out  w i th  uninvited  responses 
such  as  the  f o l l o w i n g. 

(3)  M:  On  the  Yth  move,  I  could  have  prevented 

you  from  winning. 

(4)  M: 

I  r e a l i ze  t h a t,  on  the  Yth  move,  I 
could  have  prevented  you  from  winning. 

(Note  t h at  we  have  here  a  composition  of  pe-verbs: 
r e a l i ze  and  prevent.  Realize  in  our  context  is 
semantically  almost  vacuous.) 

P a r a l l el  to  (3)  and  (4)  we  could  also  have 

( 3 ')  M:  On  the  Zth  move,  you  could  have  prevented 

me  from  winning. 

( i i)  N  won,  but  H  is  asking  the  question  because  H 
wants  to  know  when  M's  win  was  guaranteed.  The  f i r st 
presupposition  is  consistent  w i th  be  In  a  p o s i t i on 
being  an  o n l y - if  verb;  however,  the  second  one  is  not. 

We  can  compose  force  and  have  the  opportunity  as 
f o l l o w s. 

(7)  H:  On  the  Yth  move,  were  you  in  a  p o s i t i on 

to  force  a  win? 

The  answer  is  affirmative  i f,  on  the  Yth  move, 

there  was  a  winning  Strategy  available  to  M;  otherwise, 
it 

is  negative. 

The  presupposition  seems  to  be  that  M  did not 

force  a  win  on  or  before  the  Yth  move. 

(8)  H:  On  the  Yth  move,  could  you  have  forced 

a  win? 

The  i n t e r p r e t a t i on  and  the  presuppositions  are  the 

same  as  in  (7)  above. 

(4')  M:

force 

( if  verb): 

Assume  that  It  is  H's  t u r n.  Prior  to  making  his 

move  H  asks  M  the  following  question. 

(5)  M:  On  the  Zth  move,  could  I  have  forced 

you  to  lose? 

(9)  H:  Can  you  help  me? 

Starting  w i th  the  state  of  a f f a i rs  as  of  the 
( z - l ) th  move,  H  checks  to  see  whether  there  was  a 
winning  strategy  f or  H. 

The  presupposition  is  e i t h er  ( i)  at  least  a f t er

is  by  switching  turns  i . e .,  by  acting  as  if  it  is

If  there  is  such  a  strategy,  M  t e l ls  H  the

(did  you  have  the  opportunity)  to  win? 

(10)  H:  What  would  be  your  move,  if  you  were  me? 

We  have  two  i n t e r p r e t a t i o ns  here:  M  checks  whether

Thus  the  set  of  possible  courses  of  events  con(cid:173)

may  not  be  so  w e ll  defined  after  a l l;  we  have  some 
d i f f i c u l ty  in  deciding  on  the  correct  i n t e r p r e t a t i on 
for  some  of  our  examples.

There  is  yet  another  way  H  can  ask  M'a  help. 
Assume  t h at  it  is  M's  t u r n.  H  is  about  to  make  i ts 
move  and  H  asks  M  the  fallowing  question. 

(12)  H:  Can  you  help  me? 

Assume  that  the  understood  complement  is  to  win. 
M  has  to  check  whether  there  is  a  winning  strategy  f or 
H.  This  can  be  done  by  M  by  switching  i ts  normal  goal 
of  not  losing  to  l o s i n g.  Hence,  M  must  have  the 
a b i l i ty  to  play  the  game  w i th  i ts  goal  being  e i t h er 
not  losing  or  l o s i n g. 

The  possible  courses  of  events  M  has  to  consider, 
therefore,  depend  on  whether  M  switches  turns  or  goals. 

4.  Conclusions 

1.  The  examples  in  the  previous  section  c l e a r ly 

show  t h at  the  implementations  of  the  predicate 
complement  constructions  are  not  t r i v i al  in  the  s e t t i ng 
considered. 

2.  pc-verbs  can  be  composed,  although  not  a ll 

products  are  possible.  Any  semantic  account  of  pc-verbs 
has  to  explain  how  it  can  be  extended  to  the  products. 
This  is  r a r e ly  done  in  any  great  d e t a il  (see  Karttunen 
(1970)  f or  some  examples).  The  r e s t r i c t ed  settings  we 
have  considered  are  good  places  to  carry  out  t h is  kind 
of  detailed  checking.  We  have  seen  already  that  the 
compositions  (of  pc-verbs,  pc-verbs  and  modals,  or 
pc-verbs  and  connectives)  are  f ar  from  clear  in  t h e ir 
presuppositions. 

3. 

In  our  r e s t r i c t ed  s e t t i ng  many  pairs  of  verbs 

are  very  nearly  synonymous.  As  an  example  (perhaps 
not  thoroughly  convincing)  consider 

(13)  H:  What  would  be  your  move, 

helping  me  (to  win)? 

if  you  were 

(14)  H:  What  would  be  your  move,  if  you  were 

allowing  me 

to  win  ? 

(13)  is  perhaps  more  natural  than  (14),  but  in  our 

s e t t i ng  (14)  would  be  interpreted  in  the  same  way  as 
(13).  Thus  help  and  allow  (not  in  the  sense  of  giving 
permission,  but  in  the  sense  of  making  it  possible) 
appear  to  be  l o c a l ly  synonymous  ( I . e .,  synonymous  in 
our  s e t t i n g ). 

The  whole  class  of  pc-verbs  Is  very  r i c h.  There 
are  subtle  differences  between  apparently  synonymous 
verbs.  However,  one  has  the  f e e l i ng  that  even  in 
ordinary  discourse,  we  often  ignore  these  differences 
when  the  s e t t i ng  is  w e ll  understood. 
i n t e r e s t i ng  to  study  settings  from  the  point  of  view 
of  the  l o c al  synonymies  they  induce.
