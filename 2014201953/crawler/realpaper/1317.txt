Abstract 

A  problem  domain  can  be  represented  as  a  hierarchy 
of  abstraction  spaces  in  which  successively  f i n er  levels 
of  d e t a il  are  introduced.  The  problem  solver  ABSTRIPS, 
a  modification  of  STRIPS,  can  define  an  abstraction 
space  hierarchy  from  the  STRIPS  representation  of  a 
problem  domain,  and 
the  hierarchy  in 
solving  problems.  Examples  of  the  system's  performance 
are  presented  that  demonstrate  the  s i g n i f i c a nt 
creases 
provides.  Then  some  further  Implications  of 
archical  planning  approach  are  explored.

Introduction 

is  not  possible 

General  purpose  problem  solvers,  such  as  STRIPS 

st 
or  GPS,3  must  do  t h e ir  work  using  general  purpose  search 
h e u r i s t i c s.  Unfortunately,  by  using  such  h e u r i s t i c s, 
it 
to  solve  any  reasonably  complex  set 
of  problems  in  a  reasonably  complex  domain.  Regardless 
of  how  good  such  h e u r i s t i cs  are  at  d i r e c t i ng  search, 
attempts  to  traverse  a  complex  problem  space  can  be 
caught  in  a  combinatorial  quagmire. 

This  paper  presents  an  approach  to  augmenting  the 
power  of  the  h e u r i s t ic  search  process.  The  essence  of 
t h is  approach 
is  to  u t i l i ze  a  means  for  discriminating 
between  important  information  and  details  in  the  prob(cid:173)
lem  space.  By  planning  in  a  hierarchy  of  abstraction 
spaces  in  which  successive

have  been  achieved.

II  The  Motivation  f or  Using 

Abstract  ion  Spaces  in  Problem  Solving 

It  was  not  quite  f a ir  to assert  in 

the  previous  sec(cid:173)
t i on  that  a  complex  problem  domain  is  beyond  the  combi(cid:173)
n a t o r i al  capability  of  general  purpose  problem  solverB. 
A  problem  solver  deals  not  with 
the  problem  domain  it-
s e l f,  but  with  some  representation  of  that  domain.  So 
it  would  be  more  correct  to  state  that  a  complex  repre(cid:173)
sentation  exceeds  the  scope  of  general  purpose  problem 
solvers. 

Unfortunately,  a  straightforward  t r a n s c r i p t i on  of 
a  complex  problem  domain  w i ll  y i e ld  a  complex  represen(cid:173)
t a t i o n.  However,  a  well-chosen  t r a n s c r i p t i on  can  lead 
to  a  simpler  representation.  By  choosing  such  a  simpli-
f y i ng  representation,  one  can  have  the  problem  solver 
do  i ts  work  in  a  context  that  is  simple  enough  for  some 
useful  problem  solving  to  take  place. 

In  other  words, 

the  h e u r i s t ic  search 

through 

the 

simplifying  representation  w i ll  be  of  s u f f i c i e n t ly  short 
duration  that  a  goal  state  in  the  problem  space  can  be 
reached.  Such  a  representation  displays  what  McCarthy 
and  Hayes

d e t a i ls  are  ignored.  When  a  solution  to  the  problem  in 
the  abstraction  space  is  discovered,  a ll  that  remains 
is  to  account  f or  the  d e t a i ls  of  the  linkup  between  the 
steps  of  the  s o l u t i o n.  This  can  be  regarded  as  a  se- 
quence  of  subproblems  in  the  o r i g i n al  problem  space. 
If  they  can  be  solved,  a  solution  to  the  overall  prob- 
lem  w i ll  have  been  achieved. 
If  they  cannot  be  solved, 
more  planning  in  the  abstraction  space  is  required  to 
discover  an  alternative  solution.

The  concept  can  readily  be  extended  to  a  hierarchy

The  process  of  abstraction  defined 

in  Section  I II 
is  general 
it 
is  highly  structured  and  very  dependent  on  the  syntax 
of  the  problem  domain. 
It  is  a  f i r st  step,  providing 
no  capability  for  a  "representational  s h i f t"  that  would 
restate  a  d i f f i c u lt  problem  in  terms  that  render  i ts 
solution  markedly  easier.  Rather, 
it  employs  a  series 
of  representational  nudges  that  increase  the  power  of 
the  h e u r i s t ic  search  process  over  a  problem  space.

is  restored 

This  f a i l u re  mechanism  is  analogous  to  the  auto(cid:173)
matic  backtracking  feature  of  the  PLANNER  language. 
It  has  the  major  defect  that  when  a  f a i l u re  of  a  lower 
l e v el  process  is  reported, 
the  process  and  the  context 
in  which  the  f a i l u re  occurred  are  no  longer  around  for 
analysis.  So  ABSTRIPS  r e l i es  heavily  on  being  able  to 
produce  good  plans  at  the  highest 

l e v e l. 

This  requirement  has  led 

to  two  modifications  to 

it  has  a  tendency  to  f i nd  a  s l i g h t ly 

the  search  algorithm  o r i g i n a l ly  employed  by  STRIPS. 
The  f i r st  is  an  a l t e r a t i on  of  the  evaluation  function 
used  to  select  which  node  in  the  search  tree  to  expand 
next.  STRIPS  emphasizes  the  estimated  cost  of  achiev(cid:173)
ing  the  goal  from  the  given  node  and  deemphasizes  the 
cost  of  a r r i v i ng  at  the  node  from  the  i n i t i al  s t a t e. 
Thus, 
quickly,  rather  than  the  cheapest  plan  more  slowly. 
But  each  extra  step  in  a  high  abstraction  space  is 
l i k e ly  to  lead  to  many  extra  steps  in  the  corresponding 
plan  in  the  problem  space.  Thus, 
evaluation  function  has 
the  level  of  abstraction.  At  the  highest  l e v e l,  AB(cid:173)
STRIPS  gives  equal  weight  to  the  cost  of  reaching  a 
given  node  and  to  the  estimated  cost  of  reaching  the 
goal  from  that  node.  This  evaluation  function  changes 

i t s e lf  been  made  a  function  of

the 

level  of  abstraction  decreases, 
it  reaches  the  old  STRIPS  function  at  the  l e v el 

incrementally  as  the 
u n t il 
of  the  problem  space. 

The  second  modification  involves  postponing  the 

selection  of  one  among  several  equivalent  instances  of 
a  relevant  operator.  During  the  process  of  selecting 
relevant  operators  to  reduce  a  p a r t i c u l ar  difference, 
the  operators'  parameters 
a  p a r t i al  i n s t a n t i a t i on  of 
the  difference  were  that 
may  occur. 
For  example, 
if 
the  robot  was  not  in  Room  3, 
then  the  operator  "Go 
through  a  door  i n to  a  room"  might  be  selected  and  i n(cid:173)
stantiated  to  "Go  through  a  door  i n to  Room  3 ."  The  pre(cid:173)
conditions  of  t h is  operator  would  then  be  analyzed  by 
the  theorem  prover  to  determine  which  door  to  choose. 
If  several  choices  seem  equally  good  to  STRIPS  ( 3 , e ,,

are  equally  d i f f i c u lt

For  ABSTRIPS,  alternative  i n s t a n t i a t i o ns  in  an  ab(cid:173)

s t r a c t i on  space  might  appear  equivalent,  and  yet  one 
choice  might  be  substantially  superior  when  f u r t h er  de(cid:173)
t a i ls  are  considered.  So  ABSTRIPS  defers  i ts  decision 
when  more  than  one  equivalent  "best  choice"  of  a  r e l e(cid:173)
vant  operator  is  found. 
relevant  operator  (e.g.,  "Go  through  a  door  i n to  Room  3") 
is  used  in  planning.  When  subsequent  analysis  in  a
