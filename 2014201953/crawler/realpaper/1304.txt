The  breadboard  is  divided  into  six  functional 

robot  executive  (REX),  and  o p e r a t o r-

subsystems: 
locomotion,  manipulation,  environment 
sensing  and  perception,  computing  and  data  handling 
f a c i l i t i e s, 
robot  interface.  Each  subsystem  contains  both  h a r d(cid:173)
ware  and  software.  Subsystem  design  is  based  solely 
on  c r i t e r ia  of  functional  c o m p a t i b i l i t y,  p e r f o r m a n c e, 
growth  capability,  and  convenient  interfacing.  Total 
robot  system  integration  w i ll  be  studied  e x p e r i m e n(cid:173)

successive  stages.

F i g.  1.  Breadboard  Hardware  Configuration 

The  v e h i c l e,  on  loan  f r om  M a r s h a ll  Space 

Flight  Center,  provides  a  flat  and  r e l a t i v e ly  stable 
p l a t f o rm  for  mounting  breadboard  elements  to  be 
moved  around  in  the  environment.  T o t al  effective 
load  capacity  o£  the  vehicle  is  about  500  pounds. 
Travel  speed  w i ll  be  l i m i t ed  to  1  m i l e / h o u r.  The 
vehicle  has  A c k e r m a n - t y pe  double  steering; 
ends  can  be  steered  in  the  same  or  opposite  d i r e c(cid:173)
tions.  A l t e r n a t i v e l y,  one  or  the  other  end  only  can 
be  steered.  Each  wheel  is  independently  d r i v en  by

the  vehicle  navigation,  guidance,  and  control  system 
are  furnished  by  odometers  mounted  on  the  front 
wheels  (providing  vehicle  center  line  distance  t r a v el 
information),  a  " r u g g e d i z e d"  d i r e c t i o n al  gyro  c o m(cid:173)
pass  (providing  d i r e c t i o n al  reference),  and  wheel 
drive  motor  tachometers  (providing  information  on 
vehicle  velocity). 

The  manipulator  is  a  modified  version  of  the 
Stanford  E l e c t r ic  A rm  described  in  detail  in  Ref.  2. 
It  has  six  degrees  of  f r e e d o m,  allowing  any  desired 
hand  position  and  orientation  in  an  open  or  slightly 
obscured  workspace.  The  reachable  set  of  points 
(the  workspace)  is  within  a  radius  of  52  inches  m e a(cid:173)

d i g i t i z er  furnishes  video  data  for  c o m p u t e r - r a te 
digital  picture  processing  and  operator  display. 
TV  cameras  and  laser  are  mounted  on  a  pan  and  t i lt 
mechanisms  referenced  to  a  common  coordinate 
system  and  w i ll  be  used  as  an  integrated  scene  anal(cid:173)

{described  in  Ref.  6)  and  tactile  sensors  w i ll  at  a 
later  date  augment  the  environment  sensing  and 
perception  subsystem. 

The 

The  p r o x i m i ty  sensor  is  a  small  (about  0.  3 

cubic  inch)  e l e c t r o - o p t i c al  device  with  a  small 
ellipsoid-shaped  sensitive  volume  permanently  f o(cid:173)
cused  at  a  distance  of  a  few  inches  in  front  of  the 
sensor. 
If  this  p r o x i m i ty  sensor  is  mounted  to  an 
appropriate  place  on  the  hand, 
the  sensitive  volume 
w i ll  move  w i th  and  ahead  of  the  hand  at  a  known  d i s(cid:173)
tance  relative  to  a  reference  point  on  the  hand.  A 
voltage  signal  w i ll  appear  when  the  sensitive  volume 
"touches"  a  solid  surface  as  the  hand  approaches  the 
surface.  This  voltage  signal  can  be  used  to  guide 
and  control  the  t e r m i n al  motion  of  the  hand  in  direct 
response  to  sensed  relative  hand-object  position  and 
orientation.  Of  course,  several  p r o x i m i ty  sensors 
can  be  mounted  on  the  hand,  providing  several  sensi(cid:173)
tive  volumes  in  a  known  pattern  around  the  hand  and 
facilitating  the  design  of  a  versatile  conditional  t e r(cid:173)
m i n al  guidance  and  control  logic  for  hand  motion. 

The  computing  and  data  handling  subsystem 

architecture  is  c u r r e n t ly  based  on  a  remote  PDP-10 
in  the  ARPA  net  as  an  off-line  computer.  This  w i ll

ding  in  and  out  reach  action),  and  three  r o t a ry  joints 
(providing  the  w r i st  action).  The  hand  is  presently 
a  simple  p a r a l l el  jaw  m e c h a n i s m.  The  joints  are 
driven  by  permanent  magnet  DC  torque  motors 
geared  d i r e c t ly  to  the  corresponding  links.  Depen(cid:173)
ding  on  the  relative  position  of  the  links, 
the  a rm 
can  handle  loads  of  up  to  5-8  pounds  E a r th  weight. 
The  a rm  servo  control  utilizes  analog  position  mea(cid:173)
surements  f r om  the  joint  outputs  and  analog  velocity 
measurements  f r om  the  motor  shafts.  Holding 
torque  at  each  joint  is  provided  by  electromagnetic 
brakes.  The  a r m 's  s t r u c t u r al  stiffness  and  tight 
servo  control  can  provide  hand  positioning  accuracy 
within  a  few  tenths  of  an  inch.  A  suitable  articulated 
and  adaptively  controlled  hand  w i ll  be  added  at  a 
later  date. 

Environment  sensing  and  perception  is  mainly 

obtained  f r om  two  sources:  TV  cameras  and  laser 
ranging.  The  laser  ranging  device  is  a  GaAs  pulsed 
mode  laser  w i th  fast  pulse  (~10  ns).  The  beam  is 
pointed  by  a  gimballed  m i r r or  and  detected  by  a 
p h o t o m u l t i p l i e r.  Provisions  are  made  for  multipulse 
averaging  using  analog  integration  and  variable 
averaging  t i m e.  The  sensing  range  is  tentatively 
up  to  150  feet.  The  design  is  based  on  previous  J PL 
experiments  (Ref.  3).  Related  data  handling  p r o b(cid:173)

design  the  M CP  in  the  remote  computer  using  the 
mechanisms  in  SAIL  (Stanford  A r t i f i c i al  Intelligence 
Language  ,  Refs.  7  and  8)  for  the  creation  and  control 
of  concurrent  processes.  Operating  system  m o d i f i(cid:173)

Planning  of  motion  involves  the  selection  and  i m p l e(cid:173)

Placement  of  tactile  and  p r o x i m i ty  sensors  on

The  t e rm  " t r a j e c t o r y"  is  here  meant  to  refer 

to  some  d e s c r i p t i o n,  p a r t i al  or  complete,  of  the

extreme  is  purely  d e t e r m i n i s t ic  t r a j e c t o ry  planning. 
Any  external  sensing  to  be  done  is  p e r f o r m ed  during

Internal  sensing  is  used 
throughout  execution  to  maintain  the  adherence  of

the  other  extreme  is  conditional  planning, 
the  nature 
of  which  is  highly  dependent  on  the  specific  external 
sensors  used.  The  benefits  of  conditional  planning 
are  f l e x i b i l i ty  of  response  and  possible  reduction  of 
planning  time  at  the  possible  cost  of  increased  r e a l-
time  computation  r e q u i r e m e n t s.

ning  s i m i l ar  to  that  used  in  the  Stanford  hand-eye 
project  (Refs.  13  and  14)  is  to  be  employed.  Reasons 
include  the  i n i t i al  lack  of  p r o x i m i ty  sensing, 
the 
adequacy  of  T V / l a s er  a  p r i o ri  i n f o r m a t i on  in  the 
i n i t i al  s i m p l i f i ed  environment,  and  the  fact  that  most 
of  the  obstacles  to  a rm  motion  are  (in  the  i n i t i al 
configuration)  permanent  obstacles  known  a  p r i o ri 
and  resulting  f r om  the  placement  of  vehicle  hardware.

A  related  distinction  concerns  the  manner  in

The  integration  of  several  robot  subsystems

system  levels. 
The  J PL  robot  r e s e a r ch  p r o g r am  is

and  is  in  the  process  of  implementing  results  in 
hardware  and  software.  The  manipulator  itself  has 
been  manufactured  and  is  undergoing  final  testing. 
Vehicle  modifications  are  partly  completed.  Con(cid:173)

other  hardware  and  acquisition  of  a  r e a l t i me  c o n t r o l(cid:173)
l er  (the  local  computer)  are  underway. 
The  design 
and  building  of  the  A /D  and  D/A  interface  units  are 
also  underway.  Development  of  the  executive  and 
subsystem  software  and  the  m a s t er  control  p r o g r am 
have  begun.  The  future  concerns  are  m a i n ly  related 
to  the  implementation  of  subsystem  execution  p r o(cid:173)

integration  of  subsystems  into  a  unified  robot  b r e a d(cid:173)
