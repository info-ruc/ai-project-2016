The  objective  of  t h is  work  is  to  investigate  human 
problem-solving  behaviour  by  t r y i ng  to  simulate  it  on  a 
machine. 
The  main  source  of  information  about  human 
behaviour  is  s t i ll  self-observation  and  so  the  author 
has  deliberately  chosen  a  domain  in  which  he  has  some 
experience,  arithmetic  (see

3.  THE  REPRESENTATION  OF  THE  DIAGRAM. 

The  diagrams  are  represented  using  l i s ts  and  POF-2 
records.  We  find  records  convenient,  but  they  could, 
if  necessary,  be  replaced  by  L i s ts  or  arrays. 

Each  diagram  is  a  record  with  6  components  (or  slots) 
in  which  information

These  slots  are

4.  THE  PROGRAM. 

In  order  to  distinguish  functions  in  SUMS  from 
functions  in  Arithmetic,  we  w i ll  c a ll  the  former 
procedures. 

There  arc  four  classes  of  top  level  procedures 
arranged  roughly  in  a  hierarchy. 

They  are: 

(a)  Logical  Procedures:  which  analyse  the 

o r i g i n al  formula  and  decide  which  atomic  formulae  to 
assert  and  which  to  prove. 

(b)  Drawing  Procedures:  which  analyse  the  terms 
in  the  formulae,  draw  them  in  the  diagram  and  assert 
relationships  between  them. 

(c)  Asserting  Procedures:  which  make  relationships 

between  terms  hold  in  the  diagram  by  adding  l i n k s. 

(d) 

Interrogating  Procedures:  which  discover 

whether  relationships  between  terms  hold  by  accessing 
the  diagram. 

( i)  The  Logical  Procedures. 

After  the  i n i t i al  diagram  has  been  created  a ll 
negations  are  eliminated  from  the  candidate  tliooreni  by 
passing  them  down  to,  and  absorbing  them  .into,

and  R  in  the  second. 

(c)  If  P  is  of  the  form  Q  v  R  (or  Q  -  E)

then  we

and  R  is  proved; 

In  the  f i r st  diagram,  Q  is  asserted 

in  the  second  R  is  asserted  and  ft

To  assert  a  formula  in  the  diagram  the  following 
procedure 

is  c a l l e d. 

To  assert  P: 

(a) 

If  P  is  already  true  in  the  diagram  then 

the 

procedure 

is  exited. 

(b) 

If  P  is  already  false  the  diagram  is  closed, 
by  making  it  contradictory,  and  the  procedure  exited.

If  F  is  atomic,

(d) 

If  P  is  of  the  form  Q  &  R  then  both  Q  and  R 

are  asserted. 

(e) 

If  P  is  of  the  form  Q  v  R,  (Q  -  R) 

then: 

If  Q  is  false  (Q  is  true),  R  is  asserted; 
If  R  is 

false,  Q  is  asserted

Otherwise  a  copy  of  the  diagram  is  made  and  Q  is
