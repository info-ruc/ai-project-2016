An  optical  c h a r a c t er  reader  capable  of 

reading  handwritten  n u m e r i c al  c h a r a c t e rs  has 
been  developed  and  applied  to  m a il  automation. 

The  recognition  of  characters  is  p e r f o r m ed 
by  e x t r a c t i ng  g e o m e t r i c al  features  out  of  h o r i z o n(cid:173)
t a l ly  divided  zones  together  with  t h e ir  m u t u al 
connective  r e l a t i o n.  The  topological  structure 
of  c h a r a c t er  strokes  is  analyzed  by  a  sequential 
machine  with  an  input  string  of  stroke  segments 
combined  w i th  i n f o r m a t i on  on  the  connective  r e(cid:173)
lation. 

The  extracted  features  are  sequentially 

matched  with  standard  references.  A  new  d e c i(cid:173)
sion  method  called  decision  graph  matching  is 
f u l ly  u t i l i z e d.  The  decision  graph  consists  of  a 
set  of  decision  t r a n s i t i on  d i a g r a ms  to  be  c o m(cid:173)

High  f l e x i b i l i ty  against  u n l i m i t ed  v a r i a b i l i ty

The  c l a s s i f i c a t i on  of  the  stroke  segment 
d i r e c t i o ns  is  p a r t ly  influenced  by  this  scaning 
mode.  Since  the  p a t t e rn  is  scanned  every  bit  h o r(cid:173)
i z o n t a l l y,  no  d i s t i n c t i on  is  necessary  between  left 
and  right  v e r t i c al  lines  while  high  and  low  h o r i(cid:173)
zontal  l i n es  are  both  distinguished. 
The  stroke 
segment  indicated  by  " X"  in  F i g.  3  is  such  that  it 
does  not  have  sufficient  i n f o r m a t i on  to  decide  the 
d i r e c t i o n,  or  has  m o re  than  one  d i r e c t i on  w i t h in

scanning  the  stroke  segments,  h o r i z o n t al  r e l a t i on 
can  be  e x t r a c t ed  without  a  loss.  But  the  m u t u al

Since  topological  p r o p e r t i es  a re  found  among
