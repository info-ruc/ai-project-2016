and  the  semantic  characteristics  can  be  used  together 
to  disambiguate  which  of  the  variety  of  concepts  a  giv(cid:173)
en  noun  phrase  is  representing. 

Certain  verbs,  p a r t i c u l a r ly  those  t a l k i ng  about 
ideas,  sometimes  take  whole  sentences  as  arguments. 
Such  arguments  are  referred  to  in  our  system  as  prep-
o s i t i o n al  arguments  (PROPOSITION).  Thus, 
frame  for  one  sense  of  the  verb  make  (as  in  the  sen(cid:173)
tence  "Freddy  made  his  brother  come  home") 
takes  a 
propositional  argument  and  has  the  argument  frame 

the  argument 

AGENT  X MAKE  PROPOSITION  Y  (METHOD 

M  AT-TIME  T) 

where  Y  stands  for  some  transformed  version  of  an  en(cid:173)
t i re  sentence. 

At  every  -point  during  the  parse  the  goal 

is  to 

f i nd  and  correctly  f i ll  the  argument  slots  of  the  pred(cid:173)
icate  word  in  question. 
If  some  arguments  do  not  f it 
i n to  the  frame  of  the  sense  of  the  predicate  word  in 
question,  a  new  sense  of  the  predicate  word  is  t r i ed 
u n t il  either  a  f it  occurs,  or  no  more  senses  exist  (in 
which  case, 

the  parse  f a i l s ). 

Operators.  One  important  class  of  words  in  our 

language  analysis  is  the  class  we  c a ll  operators. 
Operators  are  nouns  that  take  arguments  (usually  prep(cid:173)
o s i t i o n al  phrases)  and  thus  have  associated  case  frames. 
Operators  can  be  verb  based  nouns  such  as  destruction

the  following  noun  phrases.  An  operator  is  also  a  r e(cid:173)
l a t i o n al  noun  such  as  father,  as  in  the  sentence  " B i ll 
is  the  father  of  Henry."  Here, 
father  is  analyzed  as 
an  operator  with  one  argument.  The  existence  of  case 
frames  for  these  nouns  as  well  as  verbs  reduces  sub(cid:173)

Disambiguating  the  Referent 

One  of  the  major  problems 

in  t u r n,  performs  an  active  search 

in  the  analysis  of  natu(cid:173)
r al  language  is  determining  the  exact  referents  of  a 
phrase.  Most  of  the  complexities  of  such  words  as  the 
come  from  the  d i f f i c u l t i es  of  determining  just  what 
concept  is  being  referred  t o. 
In  the  SOL  system  the 
parser  automatically  invokes  the  procedural  d e f i n i t i on 
of  the  which, 
through  the  data  base  to  determine  the  referent  as  each 
noun  phrase  is  analyzed.  We  i l l u s t r a te  here  how  t h is 
is  done  by  going  through  the  strategies  that  comprise 
the  procedural  d e f i n i t i on  for  the. 
In  rough  form,  the 
process 
then  it  contains  the  procedures

If  the  unknown  phrase  is  an  operator, 

is  necessary  to  determine  whether  or  not  to

operation.  Thus,  with  the  phrase  the  father  of  John 
the  operator  father  has  not  been  evaluated,  so  f i r st  we 
execute  the  routine  for  father  (passing  John  to 
an  argument)  and  then  return  to  the  parser  with  the  r e(cid:173)
sult  of  that  operation  (presumably,

If  father  is  being  used 
in  i ts  nominal  sense,  however,  as  in  "I  t o ld  the  father

referring  to  the  value  that  a  previous  execution  of  the

of  the  way  that  a  person  views  the  events  of  the  world 
is  in  terms  of  t h e ir  causal  factors.  That  i s,  we  tend 
to  disbelieve  that  an  event  could  simply  happen  by  it-

A  response  based  on  some  semantics  might  be,

So  f a r,  we  have  simply  investigated  a  simple  means 

f or  f i l l i ng  out  the  syntactic  pattern  f or  verbs,  a l b e it 
with  some  sophistication  in  determining  when  to  ask  for 
mors  information.  The  next  step  is  more  complex.  Sup(cid:173)
pose  we  wish  to  determine  why  someone  has  gone  to  the 
drugstore.  Again,  we  should  not  simply  have  to  ask 
why,  but  rather  determine  the  general  reasons  for  going 
to  the  stores. 
For  t h is  point  the  comprehend  routine 
must  be  i n t e l l i g e nt  enough  to  examine  a  more  general 
data  base.  Now  a  f a ir  amount  of  inference 
is  required: 
we  need  to  match  the  basic  paradigm  with  the  specific 
information  given  by  the  parsed  sentence.  This  is  not 
easy  when  one  considers  that  many  d i f f e r e nt  paradigms 
w i ll  probably  be  stored. 
If  the  sentence  had  been, 
"John  went  to  a  shoestore,"  then  the  same  analysis 
should  c l e a r ly  not  y i e ld  the  query,  "What  did  John  buy 
at  the  shoestore?"  The  comprehend  routine  must  be  f l e x(cid:173)
i b le  enough 
to  solve  t h is  part  of  the  problem  by  i t s e l f. 
A  large  amount  of  world  knowledge  is  needed  to  solve  the 
general  problem. 

This  b r i ef  analysis  shows  that

information  should  not  be  requested  by  means  of  a  ques(cid:173)
t i on  unless  there  is  some  actual  need  for  it  at  the  mo(cid:173)
ment.  Moreover, 
it  would  appear  that  the  information 
should  be  asked  from  the  very  highest  level  down.  Thus, 
the  f i r st  question  asked  should  refer  to  the  motive  and 
r e s u l ts  of  the  operations  being  described.  Only  l a t er 
should  specific  details  of  the  method  be  asked. 

In  general, 

In  the  implementation  of  the  memory  model  system  at 

the  time  of  t h is  w r i t i n g,  a ll  the  levels  of  analysis  can 
not  yet  be  performed.  Basically, 
the  implementation  is 
complete  up  to  the  level  of  the  sophisticated  i n t e r n al 
answering  of  questions.  Thus, 
it  has  been  an  easy  mat(cid:173)

questions

How  did  John  go  to  the  drugstore?  What  did  he  do  a f t e r(cid:173)
wards?  With  whom  did  he  go?  At  the  moment,  the  basic 
routines  to  ask  such  questions  as  "What  did  he  buy  at
