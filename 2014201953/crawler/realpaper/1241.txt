Abstract 

An  element  having  the  mechanism  of  time-

varying  threshold  has  been  proposed  by  S.  Aida 
and  denoted  as  an  IMICTRON.  Several  applications 
of  the  IMICTRON  have  already  been  discussed.  The 
most  d i s t i n g u i s h i ng  property  of  the  IMICTRON  is 
level  with  a  function 
i ts  time-varying 
of  r e i n t e g r a t i o n,  which  makes

The  other  method  using  the  time-varying 

threshold 
is  named  the  Varishold  method,  which  is 
an  abbreviation  of  the  variable  threshold  method.
