Abstract 

The  operation  of  a  deletion-directed  search 
for  resolution-based  proof  procedures  is 

strategy 
discussed.  The  strategy  attempts  to  determine  the 
s a t i s f i a b i l i ty  of  a  set  of  input  clauses  while  at 
the  same  time  minimizing  the  c a r d i n a l i ty  of  the 
set  of  retained  clauses.  E-representation,  a  new 
clause  deletion  rule  which  is  fundamental  to  the 
operation  of  the  search  strategy, 

is  also  described.

Introduction 

This  report  describes  some  new  techniques  which 

can  be  used  by  resolution-based  proof  procedures. 
Since  a ll  subsequent  references  w i ll  be  to  resolution-
based  procedures, 
In  a d d i t i o n,

(possibly  empty)  set  of  clause  deletion  rules, 

In  order  to  provide  a  framework  for  discussion, 
both  a  s t r u c t u r al  and  an  operational  description  of 
a  proof  procedure  w i ll  be  considered.  From  a 
s t r u c t u r al  viewpoint,  &  proof  procedure  can  be 
denoted  by  a  t r i p le  <T,A,z)  where  T  is  a  f i n i t e, 
non-empty  set  of  clause  generation  rules,  A  is  a 
f i n i te 
and  Z  is  a  search  strategy  i . e.  a  procedure  for 
applying  the  rules  in  TUfi.  A  clause  generation  r u l e, 
e.g.  clash  r e s o l u t i o n2,  specifies  the  conditions 
constraining  the  clauses  of  an  admissible  resolution. 
A  clause  deletion  r u l e,  e.g.  subsumption  deletion, 
specifies  the  conditions  under  which  a  clause  may 
be  eliminated  without  a f f e c t i ng  the  u n s a t i s f l a b i l i ty 
of  a  set  of  clauses.  A  search  strategy,  e.g. 
diagonal  search3,  sequences  the  generation  and 
deletion  of  clauses  as  a  proof  procedure  attempts  to 
determine  the  s a t i s f i a b i l i ty  of  an  input  clause  set. 
Within  a  search  strategy,  clause  generation  is 
controlled  by  a  generation  strategy  and  clause 
elimination  by  a  deletion  strategy. 

Turning  to  an  operational  viewpoint,  a  proof 
precedure  can  be  characterized  as  a  mapping  which 
associates  a  f i n i te  set  of  clauses  ( i . e. 
w i th  a  non-empty  sequence  of  clauses  and  pointers, 
called  a  trace.  A  trace  begins  with  some  ordered 
occurrence  of  the  input  set.  This  is  followed  by  an 
ordered  set  of  generated  clauses  and  pointers  to 
deleted  clauses.  A ll  of  the  parents  of  a  generated 
clause  must  precede  it 
trace  and  a ll  deleted 
clauses  must  precede  t h e ir  respective  pointers. 
Associated  with  each  non-input  trace  element  is  a  set 

in  the

clauses  in  the  corresponding  p a r t i al  trace  which  have 
not  been  deleted  i . e.  which  do  not  have  corresponding

The  search  space  associated  with  a  set  of  input 

clauses  and  a  proof  procedure  <T,A,I>  can  be 
represented  by  a  labelled  tree  in  which  the  input  set 
labels  the  r o o t,  retained  sets  label  the  other  nodes 
and  elements  of  TUA  label  the  edges.  A  trace 
represents  the  p a r t i c u l ar  path  selected  by  £  in  the 
search  tree.  Note  that  the  elements  of  TUA  are  not 
well-defined  as  operators  on  clause  sets  but  can  be 
viewed  as  operator  schemata. 

Most  of 

in  part, 

the  work  dealing  with  resolution  has 
concentrated  on  the  problem  of  demonstrating  the 
u n s a t i s f l a b i l i ty  of  an  unsatisfiable  set  of  input 
clauses.  The  problem  of  demonstrating  the 
s a t i s f i a b i l i ty  of  a  s a t i s f i a b le  input  set  has  been 
largely  ignored.  This  is  probably  due, 
to 
the  fact  that  no  procedure  can  i d e n t i fy  a ll 
s a t i s f i a b le  sets.  However,  many  solvable  cases  of 
the  decision  problem  have  been  i d e n t i f i e d4  and  the 
relationship  between  these  cases  and  resolution-
based  proof  procedures  has  not  been  explored.  When 
considering  applications  u t i l i z i ng  resolution-based 
proof  procedures,  such  as  question-answering  systems5 
or  robot  planning  systems6,  situations  involving  the 
absence  of  s u f f i c i e nt  information  make  the  recognition 
of  s a t i s f i a b le  sets  an  area  of  i n t e r e s t. 
S a t i s f i a b i l i ty  is  indicated  by  the  generation  of 
empty  set  of  clauses  and  i ts  demonstration  results 
from  the  u t i l i z a t i on  of  clause  deletion  rules.  A 
proof  procedure  must  u t i l i ze  such  rules  in  order  to 
maximize 
While  deletion  rules  are 
in  the  domain  of  unsatisfiable  formulas, 
practice  t h e ir  use  can  help  to  increase  the 
effectiveness  of  a  proof  search.  Such  rules  can  be 
used  to  reduce  the  number  of  candidate  resolutions 
while  at  the  same  time  preserving  completeness. 
Careful  consideration  is  necessary,  however,  since 
their  indiscriminate  use  may  not  be  cost-effective 
and  can  result  in  a  loss  of  completeness  .

In  order  to  motivate  the  formal  presentation

below,  consider 
S  -  {AB,  AB,  AC,  BC,  C}.  Notice  that  each  binary 
resolution  which  involves  the  l i t e r al  occurrence  A 
in  AB  produces  a  clause  which  is  already  in  S.  This 
observation,  viewed  as  a  generalization  of  the  notion 

The  concept  of  an  E-represented  clause  is 

u t i l i z ed  in  the  E-representation  TheoremB  which  states: 
If  S  is  a  set  of  clauses  and  C  is  a  clause  which  is 
E-represented  in  S, 
then  S  is  s a t i s f i a b le  i ff  S-{C}

In  the  next  section,  a  search  strategy  is 

described  which  is  b u i lt  around  the  notion  of 
exhaustion.  The  strategy  operates  by  performing  those 
resolutions  which  cause  some  nearly  exhausted  l i t e r al 
occurrence  to  become  exhausted, 
generates  E-represented  clauses.

The  p r i n c i p le  which  guides  deletion-directed

clauses  to  which  no  deletion  rule  can  be  applied, 
attempt  to  derive  another  set  of  clauses  by  adding

structure  called  a  mate  table  (cf.  classification 
trees9).  Two  l i t e r a ls  L1  and  L2  are  mates  i ff  there 
exist  substitutions  01  and  02  such  that  L101 
L202 are complementary.  A  mate  table  is  constructed 
by  attempting  to  resolve  each  l i t e r al  occurrence  L 
appearing  in  an  input  clause  C  with  every  other 
l i t e r al  occurrence  in  the  input  set.  The  result  is 
a  set  of  l i s ts  such  that  every  l i t e r al  occurrence  has 
an  associated,  l i s t.  Each  l i st  has  two  types  of 
entries  depending  upon  whether  the  l i t e r al  occurrence 
resolving  with  L  i.e.  L's  mate,  is  in  C  or  outside 
of  C.  An  Outside  entry  is  created  when  a ll  of  the 
following  conditions  hold: 
some  clause  D = C  (2)  Neither  the  resolvent  of  C 
and  D  nor  the  associated  instance  of  D  is  a  tautology 
(3)  The  resolvent  is  not  subsumed  by  D.  The  entry 
identifies  a  mate  l i t e r al  in  D  and  contains  the 
corresponding" resolvent.  An  inside  entry,  on  the 
other  hand,  just  identifies  one  of  L's  mate  l i t e r a ls 
within  C  but  doesn't  contain  the  corresponding 
resolvent.

The  pointer  portion  of  the  i n i t i al  mate  table  for 

the  last  example  is  represented  below. 

At  this  point  no  double  eliminations  are  predictable, 
but  an  immediate  single  elimination  results  from 
adding  the  resolvent  of  clauses  7  and  10  to  the 
retained  set  and  leads  to 

The  table  now  indicates  that  a  minimum  of  three 
resolvents  must  be  added  to  the  retained  set  before 
a  deletion  by  E-rep  is  possible.  The  procedure 
arbitrarily  selects  the  f i r st  l i t e r al  in  clause  12 
and  adds  the  shortest  resolvent  corresponding  to  a 
mate  i.e.  the  resolvent  of  clause  2.  The  immediate 
testing  of  a ll  newly  added  unit  clauses  (the  end  test) 
yields  the  null  clause. 

In  the  realm  of  satisfiable  sets,  consider  the 

following  problem  which  results  when 
AT(x,under-bananas,sol)  is  omitted  from  a  formulation 
of  the  monkey  and  bananas  problem  due  to  C.  Green10. 

The  proof  procedure  examines  the  table  looking  for

possibility  and  finds  that  the  f i r st  l i t e r al  in 
clause  4  is  the  only  candidate  for  resolution  with 
the  f i r st  l i t e r al  in  clause  1  and  vice  versa.  By 
adding  the  corresponding  resolvent  which  is  already 
stored  in  the  table  to  the  retained  set,  a  new  set 
can  be  created  in  which  both  parent  clauses  contain 
an  exhausted  l i t e r a l.  Since  a  double  elimination  is 
the  best  result  that  can  be  planned,  the 
corresponding  resolvent  is  added.  After  deletion, 
the  mate  table  is  updated  and  becomes 

A  proof  procedure  using  basic  factoring,  simple

clauses  generated  while  processing  the  mate  table 
do  not  appear  in  the  trace. 

Two  more  double  eliminations  are  detected  and  the 
corresponding  resolvents  are  added  to  the  retained 
set.  After  the  addition  of  clause  11,  the  table

In  the  same  way, 

Although  not  i l l u s t r a t ed  by  either  of  the  examples 

above,  deletion-directed  search  must  be  constrained 
by  a  l e v el  bound.  As  in  the  case  of  the  u n it 
preference  strategy11  ,  a  level  bound  must  be  imposed 
in  order  to  avoid  an  i n f i n i te  d e p t h - f i r st  search. 

Now  consider  whether  deletion-directed  search  can 

always  f i nd  a  l i t e r al  occurrence  to  exhaust.  Can 
resolvents  always  be  added  to  a  set  of  clauses  so 
that  some  o r i g i n al  clause  w i ll  be  E-represented? 
While  the  answer  is  "no",  e.g.  {Pxpfx,  PxPgx},  a ll  of 
the  counter-examples  contain  neither  an  a ll  p o s i t i ve 
nor  an  a ll  negative  clause  and  are  therefore  easily 
recognized  as  s a t i s f i a b le  sets.  For  a ll  other  sets, 
which  includes  a ll  unsatisfiable  sets,  some 
i d e n t i f i a b le  l i t e r al  occurrence  is  exhaustible  and  the 
required  resolvents  are  i d e n t i f i a b le  and  of  f i n i te 
number.  Therefore, 
deletion-directed  search  w i ll  always  be  able  to  f i nd 
an  exhaustible  l i t e r al  occurrence.

The  preceding  examples  outlined  the  operation 
of  a  deletion-directed  strategy,  but  they  did  not 
reveal  why  and  when  it  works  e f f e c t i v e l y. 
following  observations  give  some  insight  i n to  these 
matters.  Consider  an  a r b i t r a ry  unsatisfiable  set  S 
of  clauses. 
If  some  l i t e r al  occurrence  L  in  a 
clause  C  has  only  one  mate,  then  a  resolution 
involving  L  and  i ts  mate  (or  a  descendant  of  that 
mate)  must  occur  in  every  r e f u t a t i on  of  S  which 
contains  C. 
If  every  r e f u t a t i on  of  S  contains  C 
(e.g.  C  is  the  negation  of  the  theorem) 
resolution  on  L  is  essential  to  a  r e f u t a t i on  of  S. 
In  a  minimal  unsatisfiable  set,  any  resolution  which 
allows  double  parent  elimination  by  E-rep  is  essential 
and  the  eliminations  preserve  minimality.  Any 
resolution  which  allows  single  parent  elimination 
by  E-rep 
in  a  minimal  unsatisfiable  set  is  essential 
but  the  elimination  may  not  preserve  minimality.  A 
sequence  of  resolutions  s t a r t i ng  from  a  minimal 
unsatisfiable  set  and  culminating  in  a  deletion  by 
least  one  essential  resolution. 
E-rep  contains  at 
These  observations  suggest 
that  deletion-directed 
search  w i ll  be  most  e f f e c t i ve  for  a  minimal 
unsatisfiable  set  containing  many  single-mate 
l i t e r a ls  —  as  in  the  f i r st  example. 
effectiveness  w i ll  diminish,  however,  as  the  set  in 
which  it  operates  becomes 
increasingly  non-minimal
